The Brown & Williamson Tohamo

liaise Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-

for “picking a brand new ﬁght when we
haven't won the far more serious
ﬁghts about crack andcocaine and her-
oin.‘ Other lawmakers mlled for the
resignation of FDA Commissioner Da-
vid A. Kessler.

But Rep. Henry A. Wannan (D-
Calif.)saidthattheoppositiontoregu-

ly powerful tobacco indusn’y. “When
the industry tells them to jump. the
only question is, how high? he said.

to appeal to children or teenagers.

But a broader. more comprehensive

Haze of
hypocrisy
out West

THE WA Government is

hiding behind a- smoke

screen of. inconsistency and
hypocrisy in its attempt to ban
ciganette advertising and pro-

motion;

It is now obvious Premier Burke's
Labor Government wants the: bene-
fits of this advertising, such as Test
cricket matches. but none of: the
carnmenciall overtones.

.He says it Perth was deprived of
the Australia: v Pakistan Test from
November 11L its good citizens would
have to sit home in; front of their
television sets and watch it from

Interstate.

This would mean having to endhre

six hours ot‘boundary signs and any
other cigarette promotion that crop-
ped up during the telecast.

Therefore. he reasons. it would be
better to have the game in Perth
where the TV audience would only
have to endure two hours at the
signs ’— the normal tea to stumps
telecast in the host city.

Mr Burke's iuggiing‘ ot‘principles is
timely tor SA as: well. Mr Lance
Mllne’s Private Member‘s Billl to ban
tobacco advertising is before the

4 Legislative Council today.

Few could argue that cigarette

smoking is good for the health. But‘

there IS a principle at stake here

that is far more important than a‘

.ipo/‘Inicai backhand over cricket on

Surely‘ it shouldl remain a; matter
of choice and freedom to advertise _

a pnoduct‘thot is legal.
What will be the next target?

Alcoholic bell—erodes. subar. salt
optic—inc. _c_a_rs or man_y other _everV:
day products that are parti of our way

at life in Australia and part of our

advertising freedom?

DOES LUNG cancer actually occur more often in

smokers, or does it only seem to do so becauSe it
is hunted with greater diagnostic vigour in such

persons?

Recent work by an inter-
nationally knovﬁrn epidemiolo-
gist suggests that “detection

; bias " in a variety of studies

{may just possibly have pro-

‘dacf a " falsely high

-asSt-. .tion” between smote
mg and lung cancer.

Dr Alvin R. Feinstein. Pro

Jessor of Medicine and Epi-
c't-ntiolngv at Yale University.
says that if his ﬁndings of
such " bias " in a study of
more than 1.300 lung cancer
patients are conﬁrmed for the
:eneral population of smok-
er and nonsmokers. "we
may have to reappraise some
[or the statistical reasoning
that has hitherto been used
in form causal conclusions “
shout smoking as a carcino-
gen.

The ﬁndings were based on
a retrospective restudy of
data on all patients (1.331)
with a diagnosis of primary
'ung cancer at Yale-\lcw
Haven Hospital and West
{Liven Veterans Administra~
tint: Hospital during 1953-
lied-l.

The llrst clue to the exist-
ane of a possibly unrecogo
nzsed bias came with a
" necropsy surprise". Of 654
retrents examined post mor-
um 'um: cancer had been
uns (ted beforehand in
“‘3_. or l6 per cent.

further study showed that
"nondlagnosis during life"
“as highest among those
patients (37 per cent) whose

history of cigarette smoking
was unknown.

" The rate of nondiagnosis."
Dr. Feinstein said. " had a dis-
tinctive downward gradient.
going from 37 per cent unde-
tected among the non-cigar-
ette smokers to 20 per cent
among the light smokers: 14

2' cent in the moderate; and
0 and 1! per cent in the
heavy and extreme smokers.

“ There was a similar gra-
dient. but with larger denomi-
nators. for the rate of non~
diagnosis in the entire case
serzes, rather than in the nec-
ropsy group aloae.

“The data therefore sug-
gestcd that the more patients
snwked. the more likely they
were to have lung cancer de-
tected during life.”

He and his colleague. Dr."

Carolyn K. Wells. then exam-
ined the frequency and type
of diagnostic examinations
ordered for the entire case
series.

Chest x-rays were excluded
since every patient had had
one. Bronchoscopy was also
excluded since it was often
reserved for patients likely to
have operable lesions.

_ As an index test. the inves-
tigators chose the Papanico~
laou sputum smear. since it is
not based on onerability. cre-
ates no discomt'ort, and can

smokers; 63 per cent in the
light; 78 per cent in‘thc heavy;
and 84 per cent in the extreme
group." .

The team also found that
the " Pap smear search rate "
was substantially higher for
patients with a chronic or re-
cent cough (83 and 81 per
cent. respectively)‘ than for
patients with no cough (59
per cent). But within each
category of cough the " search
rates went up in relation to
the amount of smoking."

Among patients with no
cough the search rate rose
from 46 per cent in the no-
srnoking group to 59 per cent
among light or moderate smo~
kers and to 64 per cent in the

heavy or extreme smoking
BTOUP- .

Among patients with chro-
nic cough there was an
‘ analgous gradient." Dr. Fein-
stein reports. ranging from
53 to 81 to 85 per cent. In
patients with a recent cough.
the search rate went from 6-1
to 80 to 84 per cent in the
respective groups.

The Pap smear search rate.
he added. was ,lower in pa-
tients with disseminated can-
cer than in those with distant
metastases. " but in both
clinical stages. the gradient of
search increased with higher
amounts of smoking."

In a Medical News inter-
view. Dr. Feinstein acknow-
ledged that he “as question-
ing " one of the icons ” of
modern statistics; but he
strcsSed that the operative
word was “ ‘ questioning.’ not
‘atlacking'." “ The data we
have are suitable for raising
questions. not for launching
an attack," he said.

Philip Morris
Plans an Attack
On EPA Report

By EBEN SHAPIRO
Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL
The new management team at Philip
Morris Cos is going on the attack. .
The company s two top executives told
Wall Street analysts in New York last night

. that Philip Morris plans to unleash a

barrage of newspaper advertisements crit-
ical of media coverage of the secondhand

, smoke issue. The advertisements repro-.

duce parts of an article from Forbes

gMediaCritic magazine attacking media

coverage of the possible hazards posed By
secondhand smoke. They will run as- a
series over five days next week in major
newspapers. including the New Yotk.

Times, the Washington Post and The Wall -

Street Journal. The advertisements end
with the slogan “In any controversy, facts
must matter. " l

The nation’s largest tobacco company
has several reasons for the counterattacks.
Competitors have privately criticized the
company for sitting out much of this year’s
frenzied debate on tobacco. Now its new
chairman, R. William Murray, and presi‘

dent and chief executive officer, Geoffrey ,

C. Bible, are eager to confirm Wall Street
and employee expectations that they will
be feistier combatants than their predeces-
sor, Michael A. Miles who resigned last
week. Mr. Miles, a veteran of the food
industry, was never comfortable jumping
into the tobacco fray.

At a briefing with Mr. Murray and
Mr. Bible on Tuesday, top managers
at the company's Miller Brewing unit
asked several questions about how the
company planned to fight back more
effectively.

The advertisements also continue an
industry assault on a government report
that has had a major impact on the indus-
try. RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp, which'is
running an extensive series of ads stress-
ing “accommodation” on smoking' issues,
has already taken aim at the secondhand
smoke report.

THE WALL STREET JOURNAL FRIDAY JUNE 241994.31

Hundreds of municipalities and corpo-
rations have implemented harsh restric-
tions on smoking based on a 1993 Environ-
ment Protection Agency report claiming
that secondhand smoke was responsible
for about 3 000 lung- cancer deaths a year
The industry has filed suit against the
EPA seeking to have the report with:
drawn. accusing the agency of “faulty
science.”

RJR has since expanded its campaign
beyond secondhand smoke and recently
ran an advertisement headlined “Today'
It’s Cigarettes. Tomorrow?” suggesting
that bans on caffeine, alcohol and ham-
burgers might be next

Philip Morris executives said addi-
tional advertising beyond next week’s
series of ads is likely but declined to be
more specific. Despite the barrage of at-
tacks on the industry, Philip Morris pre
viously ran issue advertising sparingly.

Inside the company, the more aggres-
sive posture is seen as coming from Mr.
Bible, the veteran tobacco executive who is
known for responding swiftly to attacks. be
it on the political front or from pricecut-
ting rivals.

At the same meeting with Wall Street

analysts Mr. Bible also projected higher- -

than- expected profit for Philip Morris this
year. Mr. Bible said Philip Morris' s earn-
ings for the year would be close to 1992
levels, when the company earned $5. 45 a

“ share, according to analysts at the meet-
ing. The consensus estimate had been

about $5. 35 a share. The company didnt

return calls seeking comment.
Gary Black, an analyst with Sanford C.’

Bernstein, said the new management is *
determined to prove that the domestic

tobacco business remains highly profit-

I able. “They are going to pick the highest

number on the street and beat it ” Mr;

Black said.
But shareholders at the meeting werer

less bullish. Bruce Gregory, a portfolio
manager for Progressive Partners, a large

GEOFFIEV was:

Smoking has become a. scapggoat

I would never defend smoking except as a
matter of personal freedom. but l must take is-
sue With all of the hysteria over second-th
smoke. There seems to be a profounm
logrt'End perspective on the part of the anti-
smokmg zealots. . _

is it possible that they actually believe that ‘
the primary cause of the unquestionably dead—
ly urban smog and pollution is that too many
people are smoking in their cars? Do they be-
lieve that the burning they sense in their eyes
and throat when they are caught on the ex-
pressway in ajam is due to the guy in the car
man to them who is smoking? If they are truly
committed to reducing or eliminating second-
hand pollution. then they ought to be happy to
pay the ultimate sacrifice and give up driving!

it has been often reported that the average 1"

Bay Area driver emits l.5 pounds of pollutants
per day Compare those toxins and that
amount to the roughly .3 ounces (less than .02
pounds) which is emitted as a result of smok-
ing a package of cigarettes which weigh .8
ounces before being
smoked (for all 1
know. the .3 ounces 1
estimate may be
much too high). This
means that the aver
age driver emits
about 100 times more
in pollutans than the
average smoker, and l
strongy suspect the carcinogenicity of auto
emissions is much higher.

At the very least it is self-righteous, hypo-
critical and deceptive for the zealom to act as
if second-th smoke is the biggest air pollu-
tion problem that we have on the planet Earth.
Perhaps a simple, two-step test would help
some to balance the relative danger of these
two sources of pollution:

ll Using your garage, play three hours of
cards with three disgustingly heavy smokers.

Do not limit their smoking in any way.

2) On the very next night, sit alone in the
same garage with the smallest subcompact car
you can find and turn in engine but Remember
to check your pulse every l0 minutes.

According to the EPA. about 3,000 die from
living with second-th smoke. That means
that driving to a. restaurant and having wme

Am. Farm Bureau Holds
7 7th Annual Convention

BOYDTON — The 77th annual
Convention of the American Farm
Bureau Federation was held at the
Convention Center in Reno,
Nevada, the week of January 7- 11
1996.

The activities began on Sunday
when the Women s and Young
Farmer’s Programs were held.

The American Farm Bureau

1 Women announced that through
volunteer fund raising, the women
had raised thirty thousand dollars in
private funds to help build and make
operational a fruit and vegetable
canning facility in the Western
Ukraine. The check was presented
during the meeting to the Citizens
of Network for Foreign Affairs.
The campaign was launched in 0,0»
tober .1994 and after ten Farm
Bureau women spent three weeks in
the Ukraine with the C N. F. A.
Agribusiness Volunteer Program
. Money was donated by farm
families across the U. S. and the
project helped to reﬂect this year 3
meeting theme “Grassroots to
Global”.

‘ In the _Young Farmer meeting,
the discussion meet was held.
Young friners from many states

1 engaged in ten rounds ofdiscussions
on previously assigned topics in an
elimination process The winner
was Casey Niemann of Kansas and
his prize was a new Dodge pickup
truck The A F. B. F. Achievement
Award went to Mike DeSutter of 11—
linois. He was also the winner of a
new Dodge pickup.

At the opening session, A. F. B F.
President Dean Kleckner gave an
interesting and infon-riative address,
speaking to the 5, 700+ farmers and
ranchers in attendance .

Kleckner serves on the National
commission of Economic growth
anthax reform which is chaired by

Jack Kemp. His question was,
“How Big Government and at what
cost?“ His philosophy is cut the

budget, stop spending, no new,

taxes, and spend within it’s means
like all businesses and home owners
must do. We need leaders with an
understanding of budgeting.

Farm programs have been “over
whelmed” by the National Budget
Debate, but Farm Bureau IS calling
for adequate ﬁnancial support for
agricultural research and market
development programs These pro—
grams are agriculture’s future.
Dollars spent in these areas are
returned many times over.

Last year the ‘United States sold
approximately $53 billion of
agricultural goods to foreign buyers
and it is expected that this year 5
sales will reach 858 billion. Farm
Bureau will continue to work to ex-
pand trade throughout the ,world.

Kleclcuer also pledged that Farm
Bureau will continue to seek proper-
ty rights protection and common
sense reform of environmental
regulations and the Endangered
Species Act.

Kleckner stressed that cutting the
capital gains tax rate, raising the
Estate Tax exemption level, in-
creasing the deductions of self
employed health insurance, and
providing enhanced depreciation
schedules must remain tied to farm
program approval as these measures
will affect farmers in a positive
manner.

The farmers and ranchers atten-
ding the convention also heard talks
by Utah Senator Orrin Hatch, who
is Chairman of the Senate Judiciary
Committee.

Ed Madigan, Secretary of
Ariculture, spoke to all county

presidentsin attendance at a lun~
cheon on Monday.

Speed skater Bonnie Blair ad~'

dressed the group on Tuesday. In ,

her speech, she stressed “Set goals
and be dedicated, have a balance in
your life, and don t be afriad to take
risks. These three things apply to
life no matter if you are a farmer,
a speed skater or any other profes-
sion in which you are engaged "
There were conferences and
workshops on many topics during
the week. Some of these topics in~
eluded Risk Management, Precision
Farming, , Property Rights, Tax
Reform Dairy, Beef Cattle,

_ Government Regulations, and other

subjects. -

Delegates elected to the conven-
tion from each state discussed and
established Farm Bureau policy on
a diverse list of issues.

A. F. B. F. is organized inﬂfty
states and Puerto Rico, and' in more
than 2,800 countries. There are
more than four and a half million
Farm Bureau members nationwide
Farm Bureau is an independent,
non- governmental, voluntary
organization of farm and ranch
families.

Black Teen-Agers Are Turning AWay
From Smoking, but Whites Puff On

 

By PHILIP J. HILTS

ASHINGTON. April 18
-— Mrican-American
teen-agers have large-
ly eliminated smoking

from their lives. while white teen-
agers are still taking up the habit at
high rates. according to a study re-
ported in The Journal of the National
Cancer Institute.

 

"This is the single most interest:

ing change in the use at tobacco in
years: the success of. black teens.”
said Dr. Michael Erlksen. chiei oi
the Oilice on Smoking and Health at

. the Federal Centers for Disease Con-

trol and Prevention in Atlanta.
“We'd like to bottle it and get it to
others. but we haven't figured out
how to do that yet."

The trend is striking:

in lino, Federal surveys at thou-
sands of high school seniors around
the country showed that both black
and white teenagers smoked at rela-
tively high rates: 28.8 percent at
whites smoked one or more ciga-

rettesadayintheaodaysbeiorerhe'

interviews, while 26.8 percent of
black teen-age'rs did so.

But by 1993, only 4.4 percent 0!
black teen-tigers took up regular
smoking, according to the lnstimte
for Social Research at the Universi-

ty of Michigan. which conducts the

annual surveys for the Government. .

Among whites, the figures remains
high, at 22.9 percent in 1993, the
highest it has been since the late

1910's.

According to an article being pub-
lished on Wednesday in cancer insti-
tute journal, the change is not be-
cause at higher cigarette prices or
because the teen-agers are usirlg
other drugs, but isdue to a change in
attitude and social norms. said Dr.
Sherry Mills, an epidemiologist who
conducted group discussions with
two dozen white and black teen-
agers in each at live cities to deter-
mine what was behind the trend. The
locus groups met in Los Angela,
Washington. New Orleans, Kansas

Dr. Mills wrote in the journal that
family and community pmsum
were persuading yotmg African-
Americans not to smoke For exam-
ple. there is a belief that, cigarette
makers aretargeting blacks. Refus-
ing to smoke is part of the reaction.
Black parents are lirm in telling
their children not to smoke, and
black teen-agers have also changed
their idea of a good time, Dr. Mills
said.

.“Whereas black kids will go to a
party to dance and mingle. white
kids deﬁnitely will go — and this is
their sell-reporting —- to drink beer
and smoke cigarettes. Black kids
just don't see that as tun."

"For example, among dropouts,

instead of smoking, because black
teen-agers have also decreased their
use oi other drugs. including mari-

sen. .
He explained: "Blacks seem to be

. turning nit the message from ciga-

rette companies that smoking is
cool. For blacks, it no longer pm-
v-ldes that function. You hear black
teens saying smoking‘s a white
thing."

He noted ”that white rock groups
and periormets like Brad Pitt, Wino-
na Ryder and Johnny Depp, contin-
ued to glamorize smoking. while
bladt performers did not.

"Over all, we are very depressed
about teen smoking because we have
made no progress over the last 10
years," he said. “The only bright
spot is the black teens. It shows us
that we shouldn't be satisfied with
more than 2n percent at teens smok-
ing. A significant portion at the popu-
lation has already got it under 5

Selentlsts Transfer Genes

BYMARILYN Cruse '~,
Staff‘Repoﬁe-r o! Tin: WALL Smut-r JOURNAL

Scientists at the National'lnstitutes of .

Health, in the first approved experiment of
its kind. yesterday implanted a non- human
gene into a patient. . - ' ‘

The experiment, which had run a year-

' ,iong obstacle course of regulatory ap-~

provals and litigation, brings the decade-
old science of gene-splicing into direct hu-
man application for the first time since a
Califomia scientist made an unauthorized

attempt several years ago to cure a blood

disorder. That earlier effort ended in fail-
ure and scientific censure. - -'.

, StevenA. Rosenberg, w. French Ander- "
son and R. Michael Blaese yesterday in-

fused a cancer patient with cancer-fighting
cells bearing a special marker gene that
will be used to track those cells in the body

and monitor their progress against the tu~

mor. "It's an important day for us. be
' cause we're desperately anxious to develop
~ better cancer treatments." Dr. Rosenberg
said in an interview. “But it has a signifi-
cance beyond cancer treatment for future

gene therapy." ~
'The patient was drawn [mm a group of

volunteers with advanced malignant mela-j

minutes to infuse about half a liter of
milky white solution containing almost i00’
billion cells bearing the marker gene.

' The gene transfer isn't int‘endedas ther-
apy in itself. but is an extension of Dr. Ro-

By GINA KO LATA

 

Y most objective meas-
ures, Dr. Julie A. Swain is.
like her twin sister, a stun-
ning success.

She is the chief of cardiovascular
surgery at the University of Nevada
School of Medicine, a member of a
Food and Drug Administration com-
mittee that evaluates new devices, a
member of an Agency for Health
Care Policy committee that devel-
o'ps medical practice guidelines and
a member of the Defense Depart-
ment's peer-review committee for
quality assurance.

A decade ago, when she was at
Louisiana State University, she was
the first woman to be chief of cardi-
ac surgery at an American medical
school. And, like her sister, she
evokes effusive praise from col-
leagues.

Bht Dr. Swain is bitter about her
career. She, like her sister, wants to
be the best, and the best, to her, is a
position as chief of cardiology at a
major medical center. something no
woman has yet achieved. "I'm chief
of cardiology at a very small medi-
cal school," she said.

Her failure to reach her goal is not
for lack of hard work. Dr. Swain

 

~typically works from'6130 in the

morning until 9 at night. She IS di-,
vorced and has no children, and she
lives and breathes surgery.

And, apparently, it is not for lack
of talent. Dr. Michael DeBakey, the
eminent heart surgeon at Baylor
University in Houston. said she
“meets what I would regard as the
highest requirements."

Dr. Swain "is very industrious and
very devoted to her career and very
able," he added. "I think she has the
ability to succeed at the very top."

But Dr. Swain believes that the top
positions are essentially closed to
women. if advancement were just
based on “hard work and how good
you are. it would be wonderful," she
said. Women surgeons say it is much
harder for them to get Jobs, and
when they do get positions as sur-
geons. Dr. Swain added. they find it
hard to get patients. She explained
that surgeons are dependent on re-
ferrals for patients, and many doc~

ty of Nevada School of Medicine.

 

tors will not send their patients to a
female heart surgeon.

“There probably will‘be a woman
President before there is a woman
chief of surgery at a major medical
school," she said.

_Dr. Stephen E. Epstein, chief of
cardiology at the National Heart,
Lung and Blood institute in Bethes-
da, Md, who has worked with Dr.
Swain, said she is an “excellent car-
diac surgeon" and that ”she did a
superb job" at the heart institute._
But he agrees that heart surgery “is
a very hard field to get into as a
woman."

Dr. DeBakey was reluctant to say
that a hostile climate toward women
had kept Dr. S‘wain and other able
women from the top ranks. There
are few such positions and many
talented surgeons. he said. "Some-
times it's just related to what oppor-
tunities are available." he said.
“Lady luck plays a role."

But Dr. Swain said that if she
could live her life over again. she
would steer clear of surgery. "I
would probably do interventional
cardiology." she said.

ﬁnser spoils Mansell’s fun

. PORTLAND Ore. (AP)——It
‘ was almost a superhuman effort
for Nigel Mansill, and it still
wasn’t enough Saturday as Al
Unser In, the point man on the
dominating MW
Wmtche e ole for to-

‘ day’s Budweiser-GI. p’Joes 200
at Portland International Speed-

iway

Mansell showed up at the

post-qualifying interview with
his driving suit soaked by perspi-

ration and his energy spent after
doing every-
thing in his

 

1Bower to wit; AUTO

IS secon

straight Port- ﬂ
land pole.

The defending PPG Cup
chain ion did break the track
record with a lap of
116. 651 mph, but Unser’s Pfast
lap of 116. 861, coming in the ﬁ~
nal 60 seconds of the 30~minute
session, gave him his second
pole of the season and ﬁfth of his
career.

“I wrung it's neck out there,”
Mansell said of his Ford Cos-
worth-powered Lola. “I proba-
bly had one of the few cars aur-
borne through half the chicane.
It was the best we could do and
I’m just 'glad we were able to

pushhimaswellaswedid.

“But, give the Penslce team
it’ 5 due, that was a brilliant lap”

Mansell has yet to win his ﬁrst
race this season while watching
the Penske trio of Unser, former
track record-holder Emerson Fit-
tipaldi and Paul Tracy win ﬁve

of six, including the last ﬁve in a
row.

 

A Nigel Mansell pulls a mask
over his head as he prepares
for qualiﬁcations for today’s
BudweiserGJ. Joe‘s 200 Indy-
car race. Mansell broke the

track record and had the pole

position until Al Unser, Jr.
snatched it away in the ﬁnal
minute of Saturday’s qualifying.

Now the Englishman ﬁnds
himself surrounded by Marlboro
red and White with Unser along-
side on the Eiont row and Fitti-
paldi and Tracy right behind in
the second row for the start of
today’s 102-bp, 189.9-mile event
on the 1.95-mile, nine-turn road
course.

Fittipaldi, whose record was
115.730, also broke the mark
with a 116.1101, followed by Tra:
cy’5115.685. _

Rookie Jacques Villeneuve
was ﬁfth at 115. 604, followed by
Jimmy Vasser (115. 370), Robby
Gordon and Mauricio Gug
(both 114.849) and Michael An-

dretti a three-time Portland win-
ner and winner of the season-
opener in Australia (114 700).

Unser, who won from the pole
last month in the Indianapolis
500, said of Saturday’s perfor-
mance: "A lot of it hadp to do
with cloud cover that came over
near the end. The sun was heat-
ing down halfway through (the
sassion) and 1 was working on
the balance of the car, trying to
get 1t right.

"And we were also keeping an
eye on Nigel because he can
throw down a fast one at any
time."

The pole was worth one more
point to Unser, who now leads
Fitlipaldi 83-70 in the driver
standings Andretti 15 third at 59
followed by Gordon (52),
Mansell (46), and Tracy, coming
off a win at Detroit, and Vassar
(both 36).

Now Mansell who' says he
still believes he is in the points
race with 10 events remaining,

must ﬁnd a way to beat the three »

Ilmor-powered Penskes.

“Perhaps I ought to paint my
car red and whitefor the race be-
cause I lmow With these three

Penskes around me, it’s going to
be difﬁcult to win,” Mansell said
with a weak grin.

“But I give my boys credit,”
he added “Up-until one minute
to go, we thought we might have
gotten the pole. In the race, the
Penskes will be hard to heat, but
you just have to go out there and
do your best and hope for the

To Pay Portion of $20 Million Settlement

In an unusual move. the federal govem-

ment has agreed to chip in 5.7 million as

part of a $20 million secret settlement of
consolidated suits by 445 Tyler. Texas. as-
bestos workers.

Despite a gag order by U.S. district court
(11 all parties involved, informed sources
say that the workers. who sued the federal
govenimc-nt and several private companies
in 1974. were secretly offered a cash settle-
ment in September. The suit: allege public
and private negligence that allowed workers
to be exposed innocently to cancer-causing
asbestos. specifically a type called amosite.
The settlement. which allows wnclusion of
the suits without specific blame being
placed with anyone. was sealed until at least
Thursday.

The Tyler workers sued the companies
that owned the plant since its opening in
154 until it closed in 1972 as well as asbes-
tos suppliers. The defendants include Pitts-
lsirgh Corning Corp. a company jointly
owned by PPG industries Inc. and Coming
Glass Works that operated the Tyler plant
from 1962 until 1972. These three companies
will pay workers about $8.1 million. sources

against the government was that as the

Sources said that some asbestos used at

and said GSA still sells asbestos. altbwgh it

The suits were brought after Tyler work-

proposed settlement and other defendants
weren't available for comment.

Although he declined comment on
whether a settlement had been reached. one
attorney for numerous plaintiffs said that
the case's outcome "won't be of precederr

La Tribune Desfosses, 12 Jul 1995, p.29:—

CNCE,< a French association in charge of
making sure that the Evin bill on limiting
advertisement on tobacco and alcoholic products
is enforced properly, >is being involved in a
number of legal issues with tobacco makers in
France.

This is because the tobacco manufacturers are
bypassing the Evin bill. which proves to be
difficult to enforce.

In addition to contesting a number of
statements of the bill, like arguing that it is
a hindrance to personal freedom, the tobacco
makers keep presenting scientific surveys which
ten& to prove that tobacco cannot damage health.

CNCT also Eights this. arguing that the
studies are biased owing to the fact that the
tobacco makers finance them. The association
denounced recently a study by JeanrJacques Rosa
of IEP<, the French institute of political
studies>, which showed that tobacco was more
profitable than damageable to the community.
The study was financed by CDIT, the French
entity which supplies information and
documentation on tobacco>.

SPAIN: TAX INCREASES PLANNED

Cinco Dias. 10 Jul £995, p.15:—

The newspaper reports that the Spanish
Treasury is in principle planning a 3.5%
increase in the special taxes on petrol
products, alcohol and tobacco for the beginning
of 1995. This measure will increase tax revenue
by Eta 61,136mn, with Pta 45,150mn coming from
the Pte 2 per litre increase in petrol and
ﬂiesel prices.

In the tobacco area it is estimated that the
price of a packet of cigarettes will increase
by Pte 10, including the increased tax and
price rises from Tabacalera. Finally, in the
alcohol area a litre of pure alcohol will
increase by 30%.

Leslie gets his firs
Grand National win

THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

. CLERMONT, Ind. — Tracy
Leslie, taking advantage of spins
and wrecks that sidelined the
frontrunners, beat David Green to
the ﬁnish line by .73 seconds Satur-
day ni ht in winning the Kroger
200 N SCAR Grand National race
at Indianapolis Raceway Park.

The victory was the ﬁrst in 77

» Grand National starts for Leslie.

“1 can’t sa enough about the
crew. They di it,” Leslie said. “We
don’t know how many bumps (the
Oldsmobile) has on it and now it‘s
fit one on the root" from where

slie stood on it in victory circle.

“But we don’t care.”

Todd Bodine and Robert
Pressley were ﬁghting for the lead
on la 172 when the came up on
the sewer Buick 0 Troy Beebe.
Pressley’s Chevrolet took the low
side and Bodine’s Chevy the high,
and'all three spun into the wall.
Tommy Houston's Ford, running
third at the time, also became in~
volved, as did the Chevys of Lany
Pearson and Steve Grissom. A red
ﬂag was shown to stop the ﬁeld
while tracks crews cleaned up the
mess.

No drivers were hurt.

Winston Cup veteran Terry
[abonte rallied from three laps
down to take third with Burton
coming home fourth.

Polesitter Ernie Irvan was the
fastest car on the track much of the
night but his Chevy blew an engine
on lap lSl.

Mansell, runnirt only the second
SOO—mile race or" is career, domi-
nated the ZSO-lap race on the 2-
mile, highdnanked oval and re-
gained the IndyCar PPG C up’ point
ead from Emerson Fittipaldi, who
struggled to a 13th~placc ﬁnish on
the hot, humid afternoon.

The Briton, who was the Fomtu—
la One champion last season, took
the lead from pole-winner Andretti
on the 28th la and led 2 ofthe last
221 laps, inc udin the ﬁnal 167.

Mansell, who nished third to
Fittipaldi in May in his ﬁrst India»
napolis 500, had more problems
with the rou h track and the heat
on Sunday t an he did with any
other driver in the 23-car field.

“The circuit is just fantastic,“ he
said. “It stands alone, just like Indi-
anapolis. I’ve never dnven anything
like it in m life and it’s beaten me.
I‘m lad t ere wasn‘t another [0

just at the end and I don’t mind

telling the world I‘m tired."

Mansell crossed the ﬁnish line
9.434 seconds ahead of Andretti,
with Arie Luyendyk of the Nether-
lands, who was the Indy runnerup,
a lap down in third and Boesel an
other lap back in fourth.

in certifying Continental Vending Machine
Corp.'s financial statements more than five
years ago. 5

The three members of the big. nationwide
accounting firm were convicted by a. jury. last
June in a Federal district court on one count of
conspiracy and two of mail fraud.- Carl J. Si-

fine of $7.000. Robert H. Kaiser. also 44. and a
partner in the firm. and Melvin S. E‘ishman, a
38-year-old audit manager. were fined $5,000

The case has been closely watched by the
accounting profession and is expected by many
experts in the field to have a far-reaching im-
pact whatever the final outcome. This is be-
cause a. key: element was whether the three Ly-
brand men violated so-called generally accept-
ed aocounting principles in their dealings with
Continental Vending.
l962 Report‘s Involved

In essence, the Lybrand men were charged
with conspiring to put false information in the

vending concem's 1982 financial reports to .
shareholdersand the Securities and Exchange ‘
Commission, and with conspiring to leave out
some material facts from the reports.

“Sloppy Bit of Business" ~ ‘ , v
Judge Mansfield said the accountants were
guilty oft "a. pretty sloppy. bit of business" in
putting together a footnote for Continents
Vendﬁng's 1962 balance sheet. The footnote lat-
ter turned out to be a. major element in the GOV"
‘emment's case. The Government contended
the footnote misled readers of the statement
into believing that a major asset? in the form of j
an account receivable from Valley Commercial .
Oorp.. an afﬁliate. was adequately secured by: ‘
collateral. The Government also charged that
the footnote covered up the true status of the
. collecttbilisty of the receivable.
' The Government had charged the footnote
helped conceal the fact that Harold Roth, the
former president of Continental Vending. was
actually siphoning oft money. from the compa-
hny for his personall use. through Valley Com-
. mercial, which he also controlled. '
Mr. Roth was named as a defendant. along:
with the three Lybrand men. when a Federal;
grand jury returned an indictment in October
1966. He later pleaded guilty to one count of
conspiracy and appeared as a. witness for the
prosecution in the accountants' trial. Mr. Roth
is scheduled to be sentenced Oct. 8. Still open
against him are five mall-fraud counts. 3" ﬁg

Smoking: A Bum Rap?

' Smoking” which may he hazard-
oust to the health, may not be as
hazardous as antismoking‘ advocates
have alleged. So says Canadian Prof.
Theodore‘D. Sterling. And coinciden-
tally eight of the nation’s tobaccol
companies are once again underwrit-
ing a projectin hopes of proving the
pointl . -' '

Professor Sterling told the Ameri-
can Association for the Advancement.l
of Science in Washington, D.C.‘: “By‘
and large, studies‘on the effects of
pollutants are so designed that they
tend to underplay the effects of in-
dustrial on air pollutants On‘ health,
while studies on the effects of smok~

ing‘ are so designed that they would
overestimate the effects or smoking
on health." He also charged that the
American Cancer Society and the
U.S. Public Health Service are with-
holding information needed‘ for a
“dispasslonate evaluatiOn"‘orclgaret
smoking's link to lung cancer.

Eightl tobacCOl companies appar»
ently agree. They announced finan—
cing olia $2.8‘miilion Wt
oaLSchaol—investlgation into the re‘
lationship between tobacooi smoking
and lung and heartl disease. Said one
researcher on the five-year project:
“While it is common knowledge thatl
cigaret smoking has heenlalleged to
be a major cause of these diseases,
many otherl footprs may also be im-
portant" Among them: air pollut-
ants and human genetic differences

The‘law, which will expire on June 3 unless

.. , . » : - renewed by Congress, was included inrthe act
A proposed government ban on Cigaret adver-

tising on television and radio has‘drawn the lines

; for a major congressional battle between pro- and

' anti-tobacco forces, but the possibility arose to-
day that the controversy will end in a compro-
mise that will limit -- but not end — such smok-
ing_commerciais. ‘ -. '* .

I. ‘The battle. which was fought to a draw four
' years ago, was kicked off yesterday when the
Federal Communications Commission (FCC) vot-
ed 6 to 1 to propose a rule forbidding cigaret ads
«- on TV and radio. ' ‘~

The FCC's action followed a speech Friday by
Sen. Frank E. Moss.
. cigaretl advertising, who warned he would filibus-
ter if necessary to prevent renewal of a 1965 law
which forbids federal agencies or the-states to
"ban. cigaret ads. , ‘ ' i" ‘

:iOne said:

that required a warning onci‘garetlpackagesthat
smoking may be a hazard to health. Sen. Moss,
who backed the legislation when it was enacted;
_ pointed out that it had prevented the FCC‘fromi
placing any restrictions on cigareticommercials.

‘ If the lawi‘s permitted to die and if court action
by the cigaret producers does not overturn the
proposed FCC rule. TV networks stand to lose
more than. 25 per cent of theirnationalspot‘ad-
vertising. The marketing structure of the tobacco

' industry also will be threatened with convulsive

changes. In 1967 — the last year for which ﬁgures
are available — cigaret‘ commercials brought
$226.7 million in revenue to TV‘ networks and
$17.5 millionlto radio outlets. '

FCC Chairman Roseli H. Hyde said yester-
day that smoking posed “a most serious, unique
danger to’ public health." He cited‘Health, Educa-
tic'm and Welfare (liew) department statistics
showing there are 50,000ldeaths a year from lung

_ cancer, 25,000 deaths from emphysemia and
‘ chronic bronchitis, and claiming that‘one in three
- of all doaths. of men between ﬁnd 60 is related
-. to cigar-ct smoking.

COJIPRDMISES EYED
One element of? a possible compromise was con-

vxtained in the FCC proposal, which suggested an '
' examination of whether ci‘garets low in tar and

nicotine should be exempted from the TV—radio
advertising ban. -

'Some congressional sources said they believed

. I compromise would‘have to be broader in scope.-

"For the first time the legislative monkey is on

' the tobacco industry's back. The ban on action to

regulate cigaret advertising will be dead June 3-0
unless'Congress extends it, and that means that
for the first time the anti-cigaret‘ forces don't
have to do anything.

“The tobacco state Senators and Congressmen
will have to introduce a bill and try to get it
passed. A compromise ispossible. but it is aim;
to have to offer a genuine, substantiallreductionl
in TV and radio cigaretl commercials. A token,
gesture by the cigaret companies simply isn't
going to work." *

_ VAltho 'TV and radio-networks presumably would

 

be heavy losers if the FCC proposal is‘adopted.‘
industry sources said this would‘not necessarily
be the case. Advertising Age. anindustry journal. ‘
said in New York networks would not be affected
to any major extent. A spokesman: noted that
tobacco commercials generally. appear inprime
"radio-TV time and that other advertisers would
be quick to move in if these choice spots were
vacated. U f. " ' i . 7' _
'41 Tobacco Institute spokesman said the FCC
proposal. ”Is an obvioils threat to usiurp the con-
‘gressional function." .. ' _
At his press conference. however, FCCChair-
man Hyde said one purpose of the proposed rule
was to alert Congress. and thatCongress would

pg- '

. “have to be the “final arbiter" of the dispute.

The Tobacco Institute spokesman said: scien- ' :
tist associated with "more research in tobacco
and health than any other person" said that no
“causal relationship between smoking and any
disease" had beendcmonst‘rated,

DISPUTE HEALTH CHARGE . ‘ g:

.“If anything." the tobacco industry spokesman
quoted the scientist. “the pure biological evidence
is pointing away from. not toward, the causal
hypothesis." The scientist was identified as Dr.
Clarence Cool: Little. scientific director of the
Council for Tobacco Research«U.S.A. “

Sen. Moss is expected to have strong support in
the Senate Commerce Committee for his more to
let the present law expire and thusclear the was}
for the FCC ban. Chairman Warren G. Magnuson,
D-Wash. is expected to back Sen. Moss, as is Sen.
John 0. Pastore, D-Rl... chairman of the subcom-
mittee to which the issue will be referred.

In the House, pro-tobacco forces seem tube in
a somewhatlstronger position.

Rep. Tim'Lce Carter. R-KY., a member of the
House Commerce Committee, said: “I feellsome-
thing will be done (to keep the law alive). So
many things are hazardous -— 26,000 of 50.093
drivers killed each year were driving while
drunk. Why not ban TVadvertisements for beer
and wine? A group of us will introduce a bill
continuing the present law. We don't want to
destroy the livelihood of thousands in Kentucky
and North Carolina who depend on tobacco fora

Start Talking To Stop Youth Smoking

 

tNAPSA)—Parents possess a pow-
erful weapon to combat youth
smoking-conversation-but many
stay silent on the topic of tobacco.
not knowing what to say or how to
begin. Yet each day. thousands of
children across the [5.5. try their
first Cigarette. hoping to fit in. look
cool, rebel-or simply experiment.

Fortunatelyi parents now have a
tool to help them begin a dialogue
on not smoking—the "Take 10"
instructional video featuring tips
from Dr. Michael Popkin. founder
and president of ActiVe Parenting
Publishers and the author of more
than 20 parenting books and videos.

The video is part of the "Take 10"
parent education initiatite launched
Inst year as part of the Lorillgrd
Tobacco Company's Youth

Smoking Prevention Program. in
addition to the Video. which is avail-
able free to leaders of parent groups.

the program also includes the
L‘takelO.c0m Web site and a free
brochure.

Any time is a good time

Most parents want family time
together to be stress-free. and check-
ing in with kids about important top—
ics like not smoking isn‘t easy

“Kids get uncomfortable easily-
and may back away from any kind
of formal discussion." says Dr.
Popkin. "Limit the ﬁrst conversuv
tion to about It) minutes-to open the
dialogue."

When there is mutual trust. open
cummunic 'on between parents and
children isn t far behind. Dr. Popkin
suggests three simple steps for

 

establishing expectations and build—‘
ing trust: ‘ V

- Listen to your child. Come
from caring. not judgement.

- Tell your child how ,you
would feel if he or she tried smok-
ing. Be careful not to lecture.

~ Establish consequences,
explain how disappointed you‘
would feel or what you would do if
he or she smoked.

Many parents don’t realize how
strong of an impact they can make
by spending a few minutes talking
with their kids-especially about dif-
ﬁcult topics. ,

Bringing “Take 10” home
The free "Take 10" instructional
video is available to parenting and

community groups by calling loll-’

Lorillard Tobacco Company’s
“TakelO” program is part of its
national volunteer effort aimed at
reducing youth smoking. It is
designed to instruct parents on how
to discuss not smoking with their
kids. In addition, Lorillard sponsors
a national advertising campaign and

ship program aimed at reaching kids
about not smoking. For more infor-

@ Cigarette additive reduces risks

of smoking, ﬁrm says"

I ‘By Junrrn EGERTON
{0 arm Writer,

   

A new Louisville iirrn said yesterday that

It has produced a cigarette additive that re— ‘

docs the health risks of smoking.

That announcement. however. didn’t re-
ceive an enthusiastic response from tobacco
companies or health oitlclals

L Douglas Keency. prsident and chief
executive oillcer or C. A. Blockers Inc. In
Meidinger Tower, said yesterday that the
ﬁrm has succe§iul|y produced standard-
s'tzed cigarettes containing an additive that

. neutralizes» the eliect oi nitrosamiues. which
are carcinogens mociated with lung can-
cer.

The producL lo be called N-BLDCI'XN.
could be available to tobacco companies
this year, Xeeney said. But first. lasts will
be done on people who smoke the cigarettes
with the implanted additive. in a stacmonth
tdt period, bronchial biopsies and cell
counts Will he done no the smokers, be said.
to determine the product‘s eliectiveness.

Keeney sold in tests Involving laboratory
mice. N-BLDCTIN had proved to be "highly

effective" In blocking the accumulation of
nitrosamlnts In the lung.

'11:: lab work was spearheaded by Dr.
William Weddell, a toxicology specialist and
Chairman 0! the University of Loulsvilie De-
partment of Pharmacology and Toxicology.
who lor years has been researching toxtc
etlecis of tobacco and searching tor a com
pound to prevenl the accumulation at car-
cinogens. according to Arthur Keeney.
Keeney Is a iormer dean oi the Unit.

 

School of Medicine. the father a! L. Douglas
Keeney and a company shareholder.

The additive. developed by Waddell, is
composed of a high molecular weight alco-
hol. The test cigarettes with the additive
were developed at the University or Ken-
tucky, Arthur Keeney said.

“Nitrosamlnes are the most abundant car.
clnogens in tobacco smoke and are believed
to be a signiﬁcant iaotor in smoking-associ-
ated cancer of the long, We believe that N.
BLOC'i‘lN will sxgniticantiy reduce the ongo-
Ing risk of lung cancer among cigarette

smokers." he said.

Others aren’t so sure.

" With 4 000 chemicals having been identi-
ﬂeti In cigarettes .. .you aren’t going to
eliminate the health risls of cigarette smok—
ing." said Dr. Ron Davis. with the US. 0(-

rice oi Smoking and Health. But he said.

you could lower the health risk by blocking-

the ultrosamlncs.

Dietrich Hellman. a toxicologist with the
non-proﬁt American Health Foundation In
New York. said "the concept is good," but
he would have to see the data to know It the

development Ls a true breakthrough. Tohac» '

co analyst John Maxwell Jr. doesn't think
the GA. Blockers announcement yesterday
is significant tor the tobacco Industry. it has
never been proven that tobacco products
contain carcinogenic substances, he said.
The additive “isn't going to get very tar with
the tobacco industry because they ieei there
isn't anything to block," he said.

A spokdwoman (or K1. Reyn-
olds Tobacco Co. said more work
needs to be done lie-tore scientist:

' can evaluate the additive.

Keeney said the additive would
not be suhiect to approyai from the
icderai Food and Dmg Administra-

-tion because it’s a cigarette-related

product and the FDA doesn‘t regu—

Xeeney. 36, worked in marketing

acquired the parent and research

Dyer’s report, endorsed and

‘ They were: .

Penske stages sweep

 

8 Tim Puet
Associated Press Writer

LEXINGTON, Ohio — Al Unser Jr,
led a Team Penske sweep of the first
three positions in Sunday's Miller Genu-
ine Draft 200. which turned on a stop-
and-go penalty against his teammate
Paul Tracy.

The third Penskc team member, Em-
erson Fittipaldi. who won here in 1992

I Miller 200

and last year, was third. Robby Gordon
Iiiititshed fourth and Michael Andretti
i t .

Tracy, who had led all but one lap,
was penalized by CART officials for
passing Gordon under a yellow caution
ﬂag on lap 53. The penalty forced Tracy
to make an extra pit stop, then immedi-
ately return to the race course.

The pass occurred on the second turn
of the track in a narrow area known as
the keyhole. Teo Fabi, driving for the
Midland-based Hall Racing Team had
stalled his car and was off the course
with a tow truck blocking part of the
racing surface.

Tracy's brakes apparently locked
when he tried to slow down. So did the
brakes on Gordon‘s car. which slid side-
ways, allowing Tracy to get past him
along the inside of the track. Gordon
quickly recovered and got back into the
racing line in front of Unser.

"I wasn't planning on passing him,
but he looked up his brakes and almost
slid off the track. What am I supposed
to do? He slipped wide." Tracy said of
Gordon.

Tracy said that he tried to talk with
CART officials, “but they didn’t want to
hear anything about it.”

i Tracy held the lead until he made a

regular pit stop on the 57th lap, when
Unser took first place. Unser pitted one
lap later, and Tracy made his penalty
stop at the same time, allowing Unser
to hold a sevenAseeond lead.

Tracy, who qualified second, slipped
past Unser on the first lap and, until the
penalty, lost the lead only when he pit-
ted on the 29th. Fittipaldi took first at
that point, but pitted on the next lap to
put Tracy back in front.

 

It was Unser‘s sixth Victory in the 11 '

Indy-car races this season and his
fourth from the pole position, with the
others coming at the indlanapolis 500
and the Portland and Cleveland road
races. It also was his first triumph in 12
tries at the Mid-Ohio Sports Car course.

In addition, it was the eighth triumph
for the Ilmor engines of Team Penske
Tracy and Fittipaldi have won once
apiece.

Unser averaged 110.387 mph for 83
laps, or 185.8 miles over the 2Vi-mile, 13-
turn road course. The race originally
was scheduled for 89 laps, but was
shortened to meet ABC- TV require-
ments. CART spokesman Dave Elshofi
said.

In Courtrooms, the Debate

May Never Be the Same

By MILO GEYeuN
And RICHARD B. SCHMITI‘
Sta/f Reporters of THE WALL STREET J OURNAL

Liggett Group’s tentative settlement of
a giant classaction suit against the to-
bacco industry could alter the dynamics of
tobacco litigation forever.

Plaintiffs would receive only a meager
sum for smoking-cessation programs, but
some legal experts predict the settlement
will set a benchmark for the industry's
legal liability and may help potential ju-
rors get used to the idea that tobacco
companies should pay damages.

Moreover, lawyers for the plaintiffs
anticipate more immediate benefits in the
class-action suit, known as Castano and
brought on behalf of every U.S. smoker
who claims to be addicted. The industry
is set to argue next month before a federal
appeals court in New Orleans that the case
is too big and unmanageable to proceed as
a class action. The Liggett settlement, say
plaintiffs lawyers, will help them deﬂect
that argument by showing that the issues
can be resolved through negotiations.

“The principal objection is that this
case is so large and complex that it’s not
manageable. This settlement will show
that it not only is manageable but that
we’ve managed it," says Richard Hei-
mann of the San Francisco firm Lieff,
Cabraser & Heimann.

That argument will become even more
compelling if Bennett LeBow, who controls
Liggett parent Brooke Group Ltd. suc-
ceeds in his bid to merge Liggett with the
nation’s second-largest tobacco company,
the Reynolds Tobacco unit of RJR Nabisco
Corp. If that happens, Mr. LeBow‘s settle-
ment would extend to the combined entity,
which would have a 27% market share.

The 44—page settlement, which requires
court approval, also includes a number of
provisions that could further divide the
tobacco companies and give plaintiffs a leg
up in the fact-finding phase of the litiga~
tion. Chief among them is a provision
requiring Liggett to disclose “any fraudu-
lent or illegal conduct" by any tobacco
company that results in the suppression of
evidence or otherwise is “designed to
frustrate or defeat” plaintiffs.

“We’re not going to see any more of this
stonewalling and hiding documents," said
Russ M. Herman of Herman, Herman,
Katz & Cotlar in New Orleans. “if they‘ve
got them, we‘re going to get them.”

Some people say the plaintiffs lawyers
gave up too much to get those concessions.
Under the settlement’s terms, Mrl LeBow
could cancel the deal and terminate pay
ments at any time if he decides too
many smokers have rejected the terms and
opted out. Mr. LeBow could also walk away
if his former co-defendants score a court-

room victory.

At the very least.- the settlement would
enable Mr. LeBow to slash Liggett‘s $10-
million-a—year bill for defending itself in
tobacco lawsuits. At current profit levels,
Liggett would pay no more than $2 million
a year for 25 years under the settlement.

It “seems like a sweetheart deal" for
Liggett. says Larry Schonbrun, an Oak-
land, Calif., lawyer who is often critical of
class actions.

Some other tobacco litigants also criti-
cize the deal as a giveaway. “The settle-
ment is just an embarrassment." says
Miami plaintiffs lawyer Stanley Rosenb-
latt, who has a statewide classaction suit
against the tobacco industry pending in
Florida. Liggett’s lawyers believe that the
Castano settlement will supersede Mr. Ro-
senblatt’s claims against the company.

Still unclear is whether Liggett can
persuade enough states to.join a separate
settlement to resolve another slew of law-
suits seeking compensation for the cost to
taxpayers of providing health care to

’vThe San Francisco Democrat has been pushing a

the state budget,” he said. “It‘s not a stupid off the-‘
wall idea. ”

At least five states have already filed such lawsuits,
and several more are expected to do so shortly. The
Liggett Group, the smallest of the top five cigarette
makers, stunned the industry last month when it said

' ‘ it would settle claims filed by Florida, Massachusetts,‘

Mississippi Louisiana and West Virginia. 7'

Despite the potential gain to the state, Assembly
Republicans felt that the decision on whether to sue
was best left to the attorney general, said Wendy
Weber, a spokeswoman for Assembly Speaker Curt-
Pn’ngle, R~Garden Grove.

Lungren spokesman Steve Telliano said the at-
torney general hadn’t decided Whether or not to ﬁle a
lawsuit, and hadn’t taken a position on Burton’s pro-
posal. "Were monitoring what's being ﬁled in the

Allen said that "by sheer repeti-
tion," critihsof smoking “are now
seeking to give the impression of
‘mounting evidence' that smoking
is responsible for various health
problems. even though the causes
of these problems remain in dis-
pute among scientists. ‘
. "Actually. while there have been
many resolutions and repeated
stories and articles about smoking

and health in the recent? past, the '

scientific situation remains large-
ly as it was."

Allen said that “the literaure
on tobacco and health contains.
such a wide variety of fiction and'
non-fiction, fact and opinion. that

it is difficult, at best, to determine .

what the facts really are; .
“However, when one considers
all of the available research. one
finds that much off it does not fit
the theory as presented by those
who regard smoking as a seriou
health hazard. -
“It is natural that the headlines
usually go to those who suggest a
possible answer to health prob-
lems, or who present a new theory
or who make a charge.
-“However, ’a chorus of loud
voices saying that tobacco is
‘guilty' is no substitute for re-

”The position of the tobacco in-
dustry. on the other hand, does
not generally make much news."
he said, because “we do notl pre~

Certaln Things

{There are certain things we
do know." Allen said: . .

“We do know that the theories
regarding possible causes of lung
cancer and heartl disease are in
dispute among scientists.

"We do know thatl the originall
theory about smoking and‘ lung
cancer — the theory that smoke
was a‘direct. . contact carcinogen—-
has virtually been abandonedl

“We do know that in labora-

tories around the world scientists .
are investigating many possible

factors in lung cancer and heart
disease, in additibn to smoking."

Allen noted that the "case
against smoking still rests largely
on statistical studies, whose mean-
ings are questioned by many lead-
ing medical statisticians.”

He also said that "intensive
clinical and laboratory research
has failed to provide the verifica-
tion necessary to show‘ a cause
and effect role for smoking."

”1%: storyis augglout missingathe setup.

Miss the setup?Does this leave you
wondering? An engineer earning $500,000
or so peryear and a race driver worth $3
million or more per annum, and together
they can’t make their 930-horsepower,
$750,000 Reynard do what it's supposed to
do? Why, exactly?

The consequence of one car working
better than another is tiny, but huger At
Long Beach this April — a street circuit
like Toronto‘s — Paul Tracy qualiﬁed 17th.
The setup was hopeless.

Tracy's qualifying lap was 1.345 l

secon s slower than pole-winner Gil de
Ferran‘sr Imagine the difference of a
s'econd and a bit measured over 1.968
miles. Tracywas despondent. Both he and
de Ferrari were driving Honda-powered
Reynards with Firestone tires. His best
effortcouldn’t compensate for the fact his
car‘s setup wasn’t spot on

Itwas Tracy who once uttered one of the
more memorable descriptions of an ill-
handling Penske car, following qualifying
for a Molson Indy several years ago.

“Thinkorfa shoiming cart with one ofthe
front wheels stic g. that’s how this car
feels"

Tracy is now more circumspect. More
experienced, too. in Long Beach, he un-
derstood his car likely would be more com-
petitive in race trim. The Team Kool Green
engineers decided in desperation to
change Tracy‘s car to the setup Greg
Moore had used in Long Beach in 1999.
Steve Challis, Moore’s long-time engineer,
had brought the pertinent notes will) him
to TKG. Tracy went on to win the race.

"This new R ard, at least for me, is a
knifeedge kin of car," Tracy reﬂected
when asked why the pursuit of a workable
setup is proving so much more difficult
than in 1999.

“It’s either at a bunch of understeer or
it’s got a bunc of oversteerr Andi haven’t
been able to ﬁnd middle groundyet.”

Oversteer reiers to the car wanting to
pivot, with the tail leading the nose, Acar
with overstecr is said to be loose. An
understeering car, on the other hand, is
said to push: The driver turns the wheel
but the car doesn’t turn in equal measure,
its nose pushes toward the wall.

“Dario (teammate Dario Franchitti)

generally likes ouite abit of understeer in a
car — and he can achieve that in this car,

‘ whereas I can’t deal with massive under-
steer," Tracy continued.

The 2000 Reynard is an evolutionary
' design, closely related to earlier Reynards.
But two changes account largely for the
knife-edge to which Tracy referred First,
CART mandated a smaller under-wing to
, prevent speeds from risingbeyond mutant
levels, by lessening downforce. Second,
Firestone reacted to Goodyear pulling out
of CART by creating harder tires that are
longer lasting and safer, but oiier less grip.

‘llatural lalent’

Morris Nunn may he the most celebrat-
ed engineer within CART. Although he
formed his own team this year, he worked
5 with Alex Zanar‘di and Juan Montoya as
the Target/Chip Ganassi drivers won the
[our past championships in a row.

And yet Nunn points to the driver as a
critical part in ﬁnding a workable setup
i After all, Zanardl was sensational at
‘ Exhibition Place, hut Montoya, in his maid-
. en run last year, wasn’t. Zanaidi won the
1598 Molson Indy alter linishin [15 second the
previous two years He qua ed second,
sixth and second here. And yet Montoya
was an unhap camper here, qualifying
eighth and ﬁnis ing 22nd after contact

“We have to believe that if a uy like
Juan is not competitive, then it’s e oar,"
said Nunn. “But a driver has to help (in
‘ developing the setup ola car). Now, Ifound
with Juan that he is not a technical guy,
, he just has a natural talent"

Nunn cannot remember as a certainty,
but he suspects the problem in Toronto
was Firestone supplying a newly-
developed tire. His setup that had been
successful in earlieryears did notwork as
well with the new tires‘ diﬁ'erent level of
grip. Now Nunn needed to develop a new
setup on the basis ofwhat the Colombian
prodigy reported

“The feedback h-om Juan was not as
gooda the [setback from Zanardl, or from
Bryan Cl-Ierta, ﬁlling in for the injured Tony

 

l

 

Kanaan). Juan would say to me, many
times, ‘Just get it somewhere near and I’ll
do the rest.‘

“He'dget out of the car and say, ‘OK, it‘s
close enough,” or, ‘Oh, the car is s— ’Wliich
doesn’t tellyou anything So it is diEcult (to
take steps to make the carworkhetter),"

Nunn, in contrast to Tracy, views the
Reynard’s tendency to understeer as a
constant over the past ﬁve years Yet, high»
lighting the different behaviour patterns
perceived by different drivers, Nunn
became convinced early this year that
somehow the push was gone.

"With Alex, Jimmy (Vassar) and Juan,
these cars always had understeer.” Nunn
explained “That‘s what we were improving
all the time, that’s what was controlling
entry and mid-corner speed.

“Now I have my own team and a new
driver, Tony Kanaan, and when Tony got
in this car, he said, ‘There‘s no understeer
whatsoever. The car gum everywhere I
want it to go.”

"You wonder, how did they achieve that
with Lhe same uprights and suspension
geometry, nothing changed in fact I called
Alex and said he’dbe amazed, this car has
no understeer.

More grlp

“But we go to Portland last month and
Bryan, ﬁlling in for Tony, gem out of the
car and so s, ‘Understeerl You turn the
wheel. the nt end washes out”

This sort of confusion delights Noni-i1
because he can ﬁgure it ouL And it demon-
strates bow ﬁnding the perfect s‘etup

Tony Kanaan is a late raker, braldng

not only as he approaches a. turn, but as'

he beg ins turni the steering wheel. The
weight transfer m the braking affords
the hunt wheels more grip: They turn more
effectively.

Qualifying setup and race setup, of
course, are mummy diﬂ‘erent. In qualify-
ing the driver storms the track, in Tracy’s

1 words pushing to 110%, because the only
goal IS the fastest single lap.

"Team Kool Green certainly hasn’t done

a real good job wiﬂi the qualifying setups,
we‘ve done good with llie race setups,” said
team owner Barry Green.
i "We want the car basically m qualifying
I to go as fast as we possibly can. We want
the car in race conditions to go fast, but
‘ the driver to be very comfortable over the
race distance. There’s a big difference.”

A year ago, Tracy and engineer Tony
Cicale, who rejoined the team mid-season,
were considered the epitome of success-
ful chemistry betwixt driver and engineer.
Tracy invariably qualiﬁed among the top
ﬁve — after having struggled through 1993
to break into the mp 104
i This year, with diﬁerent tires and less

downiorce, they’re still a formidable part-
nership but they're not qualifying where
the want to be.
i “it’s a complex issue,"Cicale said when
. asked about the dili‘iculty. “A driver might
. report that the car is understeering, in
1 effect it might be understeering—hui that
may not he the limit ofwhathis lap time is.

“His lap time might be deﬁcient because
of a traction problem. Now, he might not
rate that very high. So it’s really quite
important to understand not only what the
car is doing, but to come to some conclu-
, sion, ’1! we make the understeer better,
will we go iaster'.” 01', ‘If we make the
rectum better, willwe go faster?’

“So it’s quite important that the driver
determines not only what he doesn’t like
about the ear, but also kind of prioritizes
that and determines, ‘Will that affect my
lap time?”

The 'i‘racy— -Cicale hip s progress
in solving such pumfthei- remarka-
‘ tile or distressing, will become only too
, obvious Saturday alternoon.

Meanwhile, reﬂect on Morris Nunn’s
i considerable wisdom

Letters to the Editor

On Ulcer Therapy

SIR: I ,read the article on "Contro-
versies~in Ulcer Therapy” (MWN, June
23) with interest.

Some years ago, I discarded the‘

theory of hyperacidity as a total

‘ cause for the presence of the benign

duodenal or gastric ulcer, and decided
that the Sippy diet was inadequate.

Benign duodenal or gastric ulcer is

 

a multifaceted disorder involving not
only hyperacidity but hypei'motility,
infection, allergy, and local endarte-
ritis obliterans. Although I am a sur-
geon, I recognize that adequate medi-
cal therapy for the benign ulcer must
include eradication of any or all of the
above factors in order to satisfac-
torily rectify the disease.

'The Sippy diet was discarded by me
because it not only did not clear all
the symptoms but left the patient
weak and unhappy. With the treat-
ment that I followed [which begins
with placing the patient on a milk-,
wheat-, and egg-free diet] not only
was relief frequently obtained, but
there was an absence of the monot—
ony of a milk and cream diet. Often

dramatic symptoms of well-being .

were encountered, particularly if [an
allergy to] milk was [causing the
disorder]. . . .

MILTON W. WHITE, MD.

SIR: I have just read with interest the
article "Controversies in Ulcer Ther-

12

freqlédl’ Wéma "k “d"

apy." There are many ideas put forth
about medication, diet, and rest, but I
was greatly disappointed that no one
mentioned anything about the effect
of cigarette smoking on peptic ulcers.

I have been in general practice for
41 years in the western part of Cin-
cinnati, and although I have not kept
the kind of statistics that research
people do, I have come to some very
firm conclusions about the relation-
ship of smoking to ulcers.

In fact, I have had many patients
come to me with recurrent ulcers-
having been treated by other doctors
without success—who healed their ul-
cers within a few weeks when the
abolition of smoking was added to
their daily routines. I have also had
many other patients who did not stop
smoking and who had recurrences, al-
though they stayed on a diet and
[took] antacids.

As a result of this experience, for
the past 20 years I have refused to
treat all ulcer patients unless they

‘ would promise to stop smoking per-

manently.
FOSTER M. WILLIAMS, MD.
Cincinnati

SIR: “Controversies in Ulcer Therapy"
interested me very much in that at
this late hour in medical history con-
troversy should exist on the subject.

Certainly there is a consensus that
if you can maintain neutralization of
the gastric acidity and establish con-
comitant normal digestion through-
out the gut, you are going to heal the
ulcer-providing the area has not
been so cicatrized [that] normal arte-
rial, venous, and lymphatic movement
to [it has been completely out oﬂ'].

When this has occurred, a gastro-
plasty or duodenoplasty would appear
to be entirely proper.

But a vagotomy at any time sug-
gests . . . surgical-medical incompe-
tence in the ﬁelds of diet, psychothe-
rapy, and physiology.

Sudden Loss of Hair Pl ment

SIR: The article "White rom Fright-
or Lack of Henna?" (MWN, June 23)

13.? "IV-3'?! I"’lI'--l

7”” “50074153

brings to mind my critical evaluation
of the subject 40 years ago in Hand-
book der Hunt and Geschlechtsk-
rankhez’ten, (Vol. 4, Part II, 1011-
1221), edited by J. Jadassohn and
published by Julius Springer Verlag
in 1933. The article I wrote for that /
collection was titled "Pathological

Pigmentation of the Skin (and Hair)

in Internal Medicine, Neurology, and

Psychiatry." _

Gradual graying of the hair iife-
netically determined. But the is
abundant evidence that canitie , or
premature depigmentation of air,
can result from continued severe
stress. However, as [your article re--
porting the views of] Dr. Joseph E.
Jelinek. correctly states, sudden whi-

tening of hair-cg, overnight or in a .

day-is still disputed as it was 40
years ago, largely because it is 'ery

 
  

complete, one partial, of rela ively
rapid development in young so iers
in World War I. To be exact,
cannot be accepted as cases
nities subita sive acutissz'ma because
the individuals were not seen imme-
diately before and after the occur-
rence. This requirement is seldom ful-
ﬁlled.

The effect of disorders of the ner-
vous system (especially the sympa-
thetic), as well as metabolic and endo-
crine disturbances, on skin and hair
are well established but rarely come
to the attention of the dermatologist.
Aside from their diagnostic signiﬁ-
cance and scientiﬁc interest, abnor-
malities of the pigment do not cause
any therapeutic stir.

. It may be for this reason that the
questions of the formation of air or
gas bubbles [in the hair shaft, produc-
ing a white appearance] has not been
settled, which one would expect, con-
sidering the advanced technology of
electron microscopy. I have seen un-
der the microscope (at a magniﬁca~
tion of x1600) the disintegration of
the medullary area of the shaft of a
diseased whitened hair, while the cor-
tex was relatively intact. _

Of Fannly Farm

. Tobacco may be providing a last strong-
‘ , ,hold for the traditional “family farm” in the
"United States—an institution which THE
MESSENGER hopes will never disappear.
" Stephen E Wrather, director of the tobac- .
co division of the US. Department of Agri— -
“ cultures marketing service, made the point.
- the other day that while other types of farms '
Vane disappearing at a rapid rate, up‘rooting
. families they once Supported, tobacco farms.
, ' have actually increased in number. This may
surprise some, but here are the figures:

Nearly 3,000, 000 farms have disap-
‘ " peaied since 1919, about 45 per cent of
the total; In 1919 there were 6,,500 000
US farms. Last year there were only
3,800,000. , ,. 1 .

.1 Tobacco farms meanwhile have reg
istered a gain of'21 000 in number since

1919~from 496, 000 that year to 517,-

. I, 000 now. . _
' ’7‘?" The decline in farms, Director wrather
‘ 1 pointed out in his piecein TOBACCO NEWS,
' has been steady except for a slight upturn
_ from 1928 to 1935,. when the depression
' _ brought about a return to the land. After
that the downturn began at a heavier pace
than ever as farmers moved to cities for-“l.
' '1 jobs in business and industry. 1 '
__ Nearly all types of farms have been af-
a'ii‘fected. Here are a few examples of the de- 7
.' clines among farms £01 the major cash crops,

' from 1919 to 1959:

Corn farms dropped in number from
4, 900, 000 to 1,900,000. ' .
Wheat farms declined from 2,200,.

000 to 931,000.
Cotton farms are down from 1,,900-

000 to 499, 540.
‘ - Sugar beet farms dropped from 47, -
000 to 23, 700.
. Among the major cash crops. only
soybean anditobsoco farms have shown

  
   
    

 

an met-ease.

. We are glad the USDA man mentioned
soybeans, which have come to be a most im-

portant crop in our own county and section.

The rise in soybean farms came with dis-
covery of new product uSes for the beans.

Mechanization has advanced rapidly in most
lines, automation has replaced men with ma-

by. .
In the farming process, Director Wrather
points out, tobacco remains a hand-tailored
operation. compared with other major cash
crops. It requires more man-hours of per-.
'sonal attention than any other, and in har-l "

corn, soybeans and such. whene machinery '-

sure the 103105 aie ripe.

Still, while peisonal attention is still the
byword for the tobacco farmer, improved
methods and equipment have enabled him to
get bigger crop yields and a higher cash re’
turn per acre.

The TOBACCO NEWS piece pointed out
that the number of farm families who depend
‘on tobacco runs a good deal higherﬂthan the
actual number of tobacco farms, since medi-
um-size and larger acreage allotments con-
tribute 10 the support of two, three or1 more
tenant families. All in all, the piece asserts,
the historical place of tobacco in American
agricultune is expected to remain stable,
which is a hope. which a lot of Hopkins coun-
tians will share. for tobacco is still an im-
portant crop in our farm economy.

Gordon gladly trades bravery
for maturity, more victories

NAZARETH, Pa (AP)—— Robby
Gordon says he isn ’t qu1te as
Brave as he used to be.

But don’ t get the wrong idea.
The change is simply a measure
of the growing maturity of the 25-
year- -old lndy- car driver.

“I was a braver driver three
years ago,” Gordon said Friday
between practice sessions for
Sunday 5 Bosch Spark Plug
Grand Prix at Nazareth Speed-
way.

“I feel I' m a better driver today
in taking calculated risks instead
otj ust making instant decisions,’
heJ said “Most of all though, I
want to win races. When it comes
to the last 20 laps, we’re going to
just suck it up and go for it.”

, With two races remaining, Gor-

= don, in his second full season on

. the Indy-car circuit, is locked in a
tlght battle with Michael Andretti
and Paul Tracy for third place in
the season standings. .

Al Unser Jr., winner of eight of
14 races this season, already has
locked up the season title and
Emerson Fittipaldi is virtually as-

sured of second place with'151 ,

points

Going into today’s qualifying
on the onemile oval, Andretti, a
former series champion holds
thirdp lace with 114p oints, fol-
lowedp by Tracy with 109 and Gor-
don with 104 Nigel Mansell, the
defending series champion who
will return to Formula One next
season, is a longshot for third
place with 83 points and a maxi-
mum ot 44 remaining.

Unser, Fittipaldi and Tracy are

teammates on the powerful_ Marl-

lgoro Team Penske, each driving \

Ilmor‘powered Penskes

“If you can split the Penskes,
you ’ve ydefinitely done something
with a Lola chassis this year
Gordon said. “And to be ahead of
Mansell, who is using the same
equipment, well, that tells you
what a great job the guys on the
Walker Racing team have done
this year’

Gordon feels so good about the
way the team has developed this

Restaurant ban should pass

The Honolulu City Council is
on the verge of doing the right
thing by banning smoking from
public restaurants in Honolulu.

Council members should not
be swayed by arguments that
the ban will hurt business ‘or
unfairly discriminnte against the
rights of smokers.

First. the economic srgmnast:

Hotel and restaurant owners
and operators are rl tlully .
worried about a d ins in
business if the ban goes into

eiiect. Times are rough enough ‘

without imposing yet mother
reason for folks not to patronize
their establishments.

The (not is. however, that
there is virtually no credible
evidence that smoking bans
hurt business in restaurants.
Indeed. in city merrily.
reputable studies of. tax receipts
and other data have suggested
that. if anything. business
improves when the ban is in
place. i

That makes sense. It a‘
majority of us do not snake, as
is the case, then a regulation
that appeals to the majority of
customers should have a
positive impact.

Honolulu is in so even
stronger position than other
cities. In California. for
instance, there is always the
potential for smoking cmtomers
to drive across county lines
until they find a place where
they can light up in s
restaurant. That won't be
possible here. ,

A more subtle mment is
the impact at such I hm on
foreign visitors. particularly
annnese and Eu cans who
are more likely to smokers
than domestic customers.

Will they choose not to come
here once they know they can't
smoke while eating? Daubtml. .
Travel decisions are made on '
Much larger issues than this. If
Hawaii has to hang its hopes on
attracting Japanese visitors on
the issue of restaurant smoking.
it is in bigger trouble than we
think.

Then there is the issue of
discrimination. It's true that the
ban would inconvenience

smokers. But that’s true also (or
existing bans on smokin in

"workplaces. public build
elevators and the like. The

inconvenience must be balanced
against the unusuable health
benefit: of preventing exposure
to second-hand smoke.

Most responsible smokers
acknowledge they have no right
to expose non-smokers to their
habit. This bn would simply
extend‘thsi thinking.

There is one illogical element
to the proposed him. It would
not apply to bars and
high uh. if the health
argument is persuasive in
restaurants, why not in bars?

The answer is pragmatles.
Nightclubbing, drinking and

' seem to be
inextricably linked. The '
proposed law simply concedes
on that point.

Why couldn‘t the Council
extend this logic and perha I
create a special category
all-smoking restaurant? If some
entrepreneur believed he could
make money selling food in an
establishment devoted
exclusively to smokers, perhaps
he should be allowed the
opportunity.

It’s hard to see Where he
would get workers or
customers, however.

Advertising Age, December 23,1968

How to Get a Woman' 5 Attention:

By Stephen Baker

The man-woman situations depicted in
the Silva Thins commercials are selling
cigarets by the millions.

Ini case you haven’t? watched television
lately, these are the commercials which

have slight maso-
chistic overtones.
There is this long
bony character who
wears no smile and
dark glasses; who
seems to be very
preoccupied, as if
in a daze; who loves
his “Impossible Cig-
arets” so much that
he prefers them to
even the most beau-
tiful girls.

He likes cigarets and hates: women so
much, in fact, that he forsakes the latter
on deserted highways, ocean liners, cable
cars, mountain tops, penthouse apartments
and anywhere else if the girls as much as
dare‘to touch his ci‘garets. He is the epito-
me of the modern male-on-the—prowl who
picks hiswomem the way you’d pick your
hors d'oeuvre off‘ a smorgasbord table;
they are merely to satisfy his momentary
appetite. He is obnoxious, arrogant and
quite possibly incurably selfish, but he
executes his rude antics with admirable
eloquence.

This infuriating oat may yet go down in
marketing history as one of the most bril-
liant creations of adVertising pundits. Ob-
viously, viewers of either sex—and partic-
ularly the young—enjoy vicariously the
adventures of the Silva Thins man.

Women (an important market for this
cigaret): especially dig the scene of “The
Impossible Cigarett” Psychologically, they
seem to feel right at home with the situa-
tions. They quite willingly put themselves
in the place of the suffering heroine.

Puts Women Where They Want to Be

The makers of this campaign demon-
strate a shrewd insight into the emotional
make-up of today’s woman. Using what
appears. to be a masculine approach in
their advertiSing, they are reaching the
very core of their feminine audience. The
hero in the Silva Thins commercials ap-
pears. toibe just what the doctor ordered.
Hisstrengthilies inihis aloofness. Ignoring
practically every rule of etiquette, he
summarily puts his girlfriendiin her place,

 

Stephen Baker

(4)

and exactly where so many women would
unconsciously like to be.

The Silva Thins commercials, bold as
they may be in their approach, are an
open proclamation to the American pub-
lic that it's still the male who rules the
roost, or should be. Here the woman is
presented with a boyfriend figure who
dominates instead of being dominated.
While he makes no attempt to make out
with her—in fact if anything he takes
the opposite tack—he establishes a rela-
tionshipithat plEases her feminine instinct.

It will be interesting to watch the sales
of Silva Thins continue to climb; The fact
that concurrently another cigaret, Virginia
Slims, is trying to reach the female mar-
ket with its “For-Women-Only." cigaret
makes things even livelier. Our guess. is
that the appeal of Virginia Slims—which
claims that its cigareti is made for women
to permit them to‘assert their independ-
ence at last—will not be assuccessful as
that? of "The Impossible'CigaretJ’

It’s easy to change cigarets. It's not so
easy to change the fundamental psychol-
ogy of women. #‘

 

Ignore Her

Silva Thins character may go down in marketing history, says Steve Baker.

Review a «triumph:
Rethinking Risk

 

When the new Republican Con-
gress convenes in January. one of the
top priorities ought to be rolling back
what Lamar Alexander calls the
“Waxman State"—the torrent of rules
and regulations enacted into law by
the likes of Congressman Henry Wax-
man lD.. Hollywood). This is an espe~
cially pressmg priority in the environ-
mental arena. where Congress and
various executive branch agencies
have spent years passing onerous
rules to deal with negligible or nonex-
istent risks.

Environmental regulation is the
source of much public outrage nowa-
days. Often the rules are a tangled
mess because Congress‘s underlying

legislation was complex in its goals '

and impossibly vague in how to meet
those goals. The real rule-making was
left to the bureaucracies. which in
turn produced their own Rube Gold»
bengian complexity. Now comes evi-
dence from a most unlikely source~
the government itself-to support the
contention that environmental spend-
ing bears little if any relation to the
real risks faced by the public.

~—L The Department of Energy has

just released a report titled “Choices
in Risk Assessment." prepared by
a nonprofit research group. The
agency has good reason to study the
subject: it could spend $300 billion to
$1 trillion over the next 30 years
cleaning up waste sites. Does the sci’
entiiic policy behind those cleanups—
and other federal actions—stand up
to scrutiny?

The report delivers some clear an-
swers: "Most environmental risks are
so small or indistinguishable that
their existence cannot be proven."
Sﬁentiiic policy is ”inherently biased
and can be designed to achieve prede-
termined regulatory outcomes." "Pol-
iéymakers. the media and the public
are unaware of the role of science pol-
icy because of a lack of hill and fair
asclosure."

7' Consrderjust one example: the Oc-
cupational Safety and Health Admin-
istration is now proposrng sweeping
indoor air«quality regulations that
v.vould include a ban on all workplace
smoking. But according to "Choices."
amajor part of this policy—estimated
locosr the private sector 58 billion an-
nually—ls based on a one-page. hand-
written chart that has never been pub-
lished or peer-renewed.

The "Choices" report praises the
government for not banning the fluo»

ridation of water. unleaded gasoline ‘I
and used oil. for which some evidence l
of risk exists, but which on balance do
far more good than harm. The report
asks why similar decisions haven‘t
been reached about other alleged dan-
gers. For example. when the EPA
tried to ban asbestos. it took into ac»
count only the product‘s hypothetical
cancer risk—not the many lives that
would be lost if nonasbestos brakes
are substituted on cars.

There's simply no rhyme or reason
behind federal environmental policy.
Even the "one chance in a million"
standard used by many agencies to
define a minimum leVel of cancer risk
turns out to have no scientific basis.
Kathryn Kelly. a Seattle environmen-
tal consultant, reports in the newslet-
ter EPA Watch that this standard was
basically plucked out of a hat by the
FDA in the 1970s to regulate animal
drug residues. Now it's employed for
everything from hazardous waste
sites to pesticides-even though scien-
tists have generally concluded that
risks of less than one in a thousand
can't even be quantiﬁed. '

"It's insane that we're spending
hundreds of billions of dollars chasing
imagined risks," Steve Milloy. author
oi.“Choices." tells us.

The road to sanity starts with more
rational risk/cost-beneﬁt analysis.
Bills to accomplish that goal were in»
troduced in the lust Congress but got
nowhere because of opposition from
Democratic barons. Now that there
are new Kings of the Hill. swift action
is expected on this front.

But the new Republican majority

 

should be careful about the language
A.—

of cost-benefit bills. As “Choices"
points out. many risk~analysis ideas
have already been implemented Via
executive order—to no effect. What's
needed is legislation with teeth-set
out clearly What standards bureau-
crats should follow. and give compa- «
tiles and local governments the right
to sue if regulators get out of line. GOP
Sen. Trent Lott. the new Majority
Whip. has introduced a drait proposal
along these lines. and Rep. Dan Mica
(R.. Fla.) Will probably follow suit.

Passage of their plans would be a
first step toward dismantling the ‘
crushing cost burden of the Waxman
State. which surely played a role in the '
voters' recent decision to part ways
with the Democratic Party. The
party’s public tastes simply had be»
come too expensive.

Some believe that now that one anti-

greater chance of losing in the Future.

John Maxwell (no relation to the

that Cipollone lawyers spent $2 million

Pentagon Steps Up Effort to Limi

 

Promotion, Sale of Tobacco in Militaryw

 

By Bradley Graham

Wuhmn Post SuHWmer

Stepping up efforts to curb cigarette
smoking among military personnel. the
Pentagon intends to ban such promo-
tional practices as ndlitaryonly discount
coupons and tobamo company pay-
ments to stores for favorable product
placement and will limit the amount of
shelf space reserved for tobacco prod-
um in military outlets.

The Defense Department‘s
nonsmoking drive reflects heightened
discern. Pentagon ofﬁcials say, about
the drain on ﬁghter military budgets of
lost productivity and rising health care
costs associated with smoking, But the
Pentagon‘s initiative has generated
sparks over the past year with a House
defense subcommittee. many of whose
members have received campaign done
lions from the tobacco industry.

A decision last summer to raise the
price of cigarettes sold in military com-
misearies led to heated congressional
charges diat the Pentagon had failed to
consult suﬁ‘iciently with legislators and
was violating federal pricing rules that

required cornmissaries to sell products
at m‘the lowest practical price." One
tobacco-state lawmaker. Rep. C. Saxby
Chamblisa (RGa), warned the Petite.
gon earlier this year not to impose the
restrictions on cigarette advertising and
marketing that defense ofﬁcials have
now formally notiﬁed Congress they
plan to put into effect this summer.

Although the latest measures aie not
expected to draw enough congressional
opposition to block them. the smoking
issue generally has placed the Pentagon
in the trying position of balancing con-
cerns about the health and ﬁtness of
service members against the rights of
members to choose whether to smoke.

For years. military life facilitated
smoking. Mess kits contained free ciga-
rette packs Tobacco ﬁrms would send
cigarettes to combat zones as a patriotic
gesture, a practice stopped during the
1991 Persian Gulf War. Training drills
allowed for periodic smoke breaks. Car-
tons could be purchased in military
commissaries for discounts of up to 76
percent off commercial retail prices.

“A lot of people picked up smoking in
the military.” said John Mazzuchi. a
Pentagon health ofﬁcial who has had a
role in the antismoking effort’s slow
evolution. "We had to create a new

educational environment a new culture
in which the command was saying
smoking is not cool. it's not good for you
and it‘s bad for overall readiness of the
force."

Defense Department attempts to cur-
tail smelting began in the mid-19805,
although the campaign was limited then
to educating service members about the
health risks of using tobacco products.
By the early 1990s, a governmentwide
effort to ban smolo’ng in federal areas
led to a smokefree Pentagon and desig-
nated smoking areas on military bases.

But raising commissary prices was a

much more sensitive proposition. be
cause the discounts available in these
govenunentsubsidized military super-
markets are highly valued by service
members. Defense ofﬁcials were reluc-
tant to single out any product as an
exception. Besides, tobacco products
were big business for commissaries,
generating $747 million in revenue and
$103 million in proﬁts and surcharge
revenue in 1995.

What ﬁnally prompted the Pentagon
to act were the rising costs of smoking
related productivity losses and medical
care. estimated at $930 million in 1995.

“We were actually asking the Ameri-
can taxpayer to subsidize a product that
we knew was injurious to health, in
which there were substantial costs,”
said Fred Pang. the Pentagon's assistant
secretary for force management.

Cigarettes are still sold in the mili
tary's 230 conunissaries, but responsi-
bility for managing the sales now rests
with the military exchanges, which are
not subsidized and so charge more.
Even so. tobacco prices in these military
outlets remain below commercial retail
levels—a fact that defense ofﬁcials ap
pear resigned to accept rather than
court more political attack

"We considered raising prices to pre
tailing market rates. and we concluded
that at least for now. the pricing policy
we have is defensible.” said Pang, “We
have not rejected absolutely that we
would not do something like raise prices
farther. That is under review now.”

A report by the Pentagon s inspector
general issued in December, urged that
prices be lifted to commercial retail
levels. "lhe Department of Defense 15
sendingamixedmessag etoitsbeneﬁ
ciary population." it said “DOD should
not encourage tobacco sales through
discounted prices when the DOD health

community is striving to reduce the
effects of tobacco on the acﬁveduty
force and its beneﬁciary population."

In a move that defense ofﬁcials see as
retaliation for the earlier price bike. a
House National Security subcommittee
inserted language in this year’s defense
authorization bill shifting responsibility
for overseeing the military stores from
Pang's force management ofﬁce to the
comptroller.

Rep. John M. McHugh (R»N.Y.).
chairman of the House National Securi-
ty Committee's panel on morale. welfare
and recreation (MWR), said in an inter-
view that the measure had nothing to do
with getting even. “It simply was an
attempt to respond better to MWR
programs. whose major crises are all
financially related." the congressman
stressed.

But the Pentagon is convinced re-
venge played a part in the panel‘s
attempt to eliminate the job held by
Stephen Rossetti Jr. a former Demo-
cratic staff member on the House sub-
committee who was hired by Pang to
revamp the military stores and impie
merit the new cigarette policy.

’l'he panel's action clearly was at
least somewhat retaliatory,” said Pang.
'lhe comptroller could certainly do the
job, but the military stores are regarded
by service members as a beneﬁt. a very
valued beneﬁt. and all the beneﬁt pro
grams fall under this ofﬁce. The pro
posed change would be an added re
sponsibility for the comptroller that
doesn’t make any sense."

In a letter to McHugh last week. Pang

enclosed a draft copy of the new order
limiting promotional displays and shelf
space for tobacco products in militari-
stores Additional meastnes banning
cigarette sales to anyone under age 18
free samples and vending machine open
ations were being taken to conform to
Food and Drug Administration rules.
Pangwrote. ‘

The Pentagon‘ s declining tolerance

Second-hand smoke —is it harmful?

remarks to facts established by competent research
and in which quantitid medial experts — including
those who often represent anti-smoking organizations
— concur.

Senate Bill son now under consideration by our
legislature. begins with these words:

“the Legislature finds and declares that tobacco
smoke and smoke from other plants is harmful to the
health. comfort and environment of nonsmokers . . ."

The Legislature can no doubt find that tobacco
smoke is disturbing to the comfort and desired
environment of nonsmokers. but to declare it harmful
to the health of nonsmokers contradicts medical facts

A non-smoker cannot contract cancer or other
disease from second-hand smoke. .

Before further addresing the question of disease.
it is necessary to dispel several misconceptions about
sidestream tobacco smoke.

Firstly. because it is diluted by the environment. it
b not “more toxic" than the smoke inhaled by the
smoker.

in addition. any attempt to measure ambient
tobacco -oke must take into account complex
variables such as smoke concentration, room volume.
ventilation.

Another misconception is that the exposure of a
aonamoker can be measured in terms of a specific
number of cigarettes Although misleading. the
concept of using a given number of cigarettes is
understandable. especially for lay persons and non-
hedical journalists

However, such an extrapolation involves highly
unreliable estimates and is usually based upon
unrealistic experiments

. «Apart from a discusion of disease. there probably
are physical irritations involved with exposure to high
concentrations of tobacco smoke.

Thh may be caused by constituents of tobacco
smoke like ammonia. acrolein and raidehydes. especially
Mien they are coupled with warm. dry air.

it is not inconceivable Ihattbe odor ahd‘hlgh
visibility of tobacco smoke play a part in the annoyance
teaction of some nonsmokers to tobacco smoke.

_ Unfortunately. definite evidence available that
such is the case does not exist. While there have been
tome experiments. which create simulated exposures.
these studies employ experimental conditions which
are not typical of‘tboee in‘real life.

The medical literature to date does not indicate
any significant health risk to the nonsmoker from
environmental tobacco smoke normally encountered in
day-today situations

it is of interest‘to examine the observations of
scientists who have generally expressed anti-tobacco
aentimenls.

ForexampleDr.ECuylerHammon.vice
president. Epidemiology and Statistical Research. of
the American Cancer Society. addramed‘ the
international Conference on Public Education About
ﬁrmer in Monaco in 1974.

A delegate asked Dr. Hammon his views on the
hanrds of tobacco smoke on non-smokers who inhale
it. The official summary proceediup of the conference

"9011:

“Dr. Hammon stated that‘tbere was ‘no shred of
evidence that a nonsmoker an get cancer from
becond-hand‘ smoke and there is a lot of evidence that
he cannot . . . He added that‘to suggest passive smoking
(inhalation of smoke by non-smokers) could cause
cancer is dishonest. and that he would be prepared to
tutify as much in court.“

Dr. Johnathan Rboada. chairman of the National
Canon Advisory Board and a past-president of the

American Cancer Society. is another presti‘gibua
spokesman for the anti-smoking movement. He
declared;

“i do not have hard evidence in that direction fthat‘
there is a harmful effect from smoke on the non-
smokerl. To my. knowledge. it is not. in fact. actually
harmful"

The “Journal of Preventive Medicine" reported to
its professional readership;

“it appears that pasive inbalatldn of (second-hand)
tobacco smoke by nonsmokers or smokers does not
increase their risk for chronic illneses such as cancer
of the rﬁp‘iratory tract. emphysema or cardiovascular

Dr. Ernest Wydner. of‘ the American Health
Foundation; is one of‘ the ma )or scientific voices of the
anti-smoking movement. He sums it up this way

. “Passive smoking can provide tears or can be
gtherwise disagreeable. but it has no influence on the
ealth"

California's legislators face a political decision
concerning what some non-smokers find disagreeable
or annoying.

To proclaim such a law necessary to protect the
health of nonsmokers is a premise contradicted by
scientific evidence. The opinion of researchers does not
provide a sound scientific basis upon which the
prom“ law may rest.

Tests With Mice Will Check Possible Link
0f Smoking, Lack of Niacin and Cancer

 

BY JERRY BISHOP
Etoﬂ' Reporter o] 'l'siti WALL S'ritttirr Jonas!“-

SAN FRANCISCO—The smoldering contro-
versy over whether there is a connection be-

tween cigaret smoking and lung cancer is be-
ing stoked snow by cancer research scien-
tists. And. all in all. it's proving to be a bad
time for mice and a confusing time for
smokers. -

It San Francisco pharrnacologist threw a
new fagot in the fire at a weekend press con-
ference. the results of which were held for re-
lease until yesterday afternoon.

Dr. B. l... Freedlander of Mount Zion Hos-
pital and Medical Center said he has found
a relationshipnin mtce— between the lack of an
important vitamin and cancer. He now has an
experiment underway to find out if this may
be tied in with a substance sound in tobacco.

Dr. Freedlsnder's announcement comes on
top of a disclosure a few days earlier by set-
enttsts at New York University that they had
proved that tobacco tar "unquestionably" con-
tains a cancer-causing substance. However. ef-
forts to prove that it can cause lung cancer
have met with failure.

Till“! Belemtlsl's Tests

And a third scientist in Maryland. also
working with mice. suggests that giving up
smoking to stave off lung cancer may increase
a person's chances of getting some other type
of cancer.

Dr. Freedlander. as had the other acien~
lists. disclosed the details of his experiments
on mice to a group of newsmen now touring
the nation's cancer research centers under the
guidance of the American Cancer Society.

So far. the only evidence that smoking has
a connection with lung cancer are statistical
studies made of groups of smokers and non-
smokers. The studies show that smokers have
a higher incidence of lung cancer than non-
smokers and that groups of heavy smokers
have a higher incidence of lung cancer than
average or light smokers. Since the studies
were released in lost. researchers have been
striving to find laboratory proof that smoking
can cause lung cancer. The proof. say the re-
searchers. has not yet been found.

Spokesman for the tobacco :n‘uelrv have
emphasised that a statistical connection does
not establish a cause and ettcct relationship.
they also note that niaiw other possibly can-
cer-i'nusing compounds are i-ihelnrl, particu-
larly in cities.

Experiment With Niacin

in his experiment. Dr. Freedlander said that
he and an associate. Frederic A. French.
have been feeding a group of mice a diet de-
ficient in Niacin. one of the B vitamins.
Another group of mice was given a normal
diet. The mice were bred especially to be
susceptible to a type of lung cancer—a type
not found in humans—and both groups were
given a dose of cancer-causing chemicals to in-
sure that they developed cancers.

The mice on the niacin deficient diet devel-
oped an average of ill tumors each. pr. Freed-
lander said. The mice on the normal diet
developed only it per mouso. strong evidence
that a lack of niacin increases the straceptt-

bllity to cancer. he explained.

The two are now carrying their experiment
further to check any connection with smoking.
They have found a substance in tobacco which
is chemically simuar to niacin. This substance.
called B-AP. can be converted to useftil niacin
in the liver. Dr. Freedlander explained. But.
he theorizes. if a—AP is inhaled it apparently
by-pssses the liver and is loose in the body as
a false vitamin which living cells may confuse
with the true vitamin.

Does the s-AP sneak into a cell posing as a
vitamin and then sabotage the cell causing
cancer? Dr. Freedlander says he has still on-
other experiment under way to find out.

Test With Vapor

He is giving the a-AP in vapor form—not
smoke-Jar the mice to hihale to see if this
increases the number of lung cancers in the
rodents.

"We haven't proved anything yet." he cau-
tions. "There may be no relation between mice
lung cancers and human lung cancers." And.
he adds. "it may be just a coincidence that it
is a lung cancer the mice develop."

New-amen. many of them smoking. re-
peatedly asked the scientist if this meant it
would help smokers to take niacin tablets in
the hope it would effect the effects of 3-AP
in cigaret smoke. He steadfastly refused to
Jump to any such conclusion. emphasizing his
experiments were on mice and had proved

enough niacin are more susceptible to lung
cancer.

The reason for using mice. he explains. is
that. they are the best indicators of whether
a compound could be carclogenic (cancer

causing).
A New York University scientist. Dr. Nor-

ton Nelson. iold the newsmen that "unques-
tionably there is something carciogenic in to-
bacco tar. though it is very weak." He bases
his conclusion on experiments where the skins
of mice were painted with. heavy doses of
tobacco tar over a long period of time. They

developed skin cancer.
He and another N.Y.U. scientist note, how-

ever. that after a year of using a new method
of inducing lung cancer in animals they have
failed to produce any lung tumors with tobacco
tar.

Researchers Frustrated

The fact that they have not been able to
cause cancer wi-h tobacco tar anywhere except
on the skin of a mouse has frustrated many of
the researchers. 0n the smoking question
however. Dr. Irena Koprowska. a pathologist
at the Habnemann Medical College and Hospi-
tal in Philadelphia. told the newsmen a few
days ago that she hind produced cancer of the
cervix in mice with tobacco tar. To do so. she
had to Epply the tar to mice five "me- a week
over a period of to months. This still leaves
unanswered the question of whether tar will
cause cancer lit the lung.

fit the University of Maryland. Dr. Frank
H. J. Figge. has come up with another strange
hypothesis about smoking and lung cancer. He
has been working on several experiments on
the susceptibimy of mice to cancer. including
cross-breeding of several different mice strains
to check a theory that obesity increases sus-
ceptibility to liver cancer.

In one experiment. Dr. Flgge says he found
that when he suppressed the susceptibility to
breast cancer the mice became more suscep-
tible to leukemia. His conclusion:

"We do not know enough about the variation
in cancer-susceptibility of human subjects to
advise them to give up smoking in the attempt
to decrease the incidence of lung cancer. for
we do not know for sure that giving up smoking
may not stimulate factors associated with sus-
ceptibility to other forms of cancer." He adds.
with a grin at smoking newsmen. "if I smoked.
i wouldn't give it up now."

Fewer women aged
13-44 are smoking,
phone survey says

THE. ASSOCIATED PRESS

CHICAGO — T he smoking rate r
for American women of c t can I
itrg age declined signiﬁcantly dur-
ing a recent 10-year period. a
newly reported phone survey indi-
cams.

Researchers [min the federal :
Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention reported that the per-
centage ol’ women of childbearing
age who had ever smoked declined
to 33.2 percent in 1995 from 4-1.1
percent in 1.987. Additionally, 31c
phi-valence of current smu ing e-
nrined to 11.8 percent in 1 from
ltij percent in 1987.

The results of the telephone sur-
vey of 187,302 women aged 18 to
44 from 33 states appear in today’s
lSSlIE of the Journal of the Ameri-
can Me it: some on.

The researchers, led by Dr. Sha-
ltul Ehral'u'm. said women who to
ported they were pregnant were
about half as likely to be current
smokers as women who weren't
pregnant — airdljo that ﬂuctuated
only slightly over the 10-year sur-
vey period.

Circulation: 338.793

ln1987, 16.7 percent or the preg-

nant women reported being smnk— .

ers and 26.7 percent of the women ‘

who weren't pregnant said they ‘

smoked. By 1996, only 11.8 percent
of the pregnant women smoked

and only 23.6 of women who

weren't pregnant did.

"in this analysis, the decline in
smelting over time among pregnant
women was primarily due to the
overall decline in smoking initia-
tiorr.rates among women of child-
bearing age, not to an increased
rate ul'srndking cessition related to
pmgnnncy," the researchers wrote.

The researchers cautioned that
because the survey had excluded
women without [clephbnes. women
younger than ill and those who did
not live in private residences. they
may have underestimated [hc actu-
al prevalence of smoking.

RJR Is Planning
Final Market Test

For New Cigarette

By Suem L. men

And Tmomv NOAH
Staff Reporter: 0! TH: WALL Swen Jouruuu.
RJ. Reynolds Tobacco Co. is taking the
final steps to prepare Eclipse. its new
low-smoke cigarette. tor the consumer
', market amid an effort to gather support

from antismoking iorces. ,

Ofﬁcials at No. 2 cigarette maker Rey-
nolds say they are readying Eclipse for

final market testing, slated totake lace in
the gisitanooes, Tenn. are e next
six to as wee . igned to

e an cancerceusinz tars by heating
rather than burning tobacco. Eclipse
marks the latest in a long and troubled
quest by the cigarette industry to come up
with a safer product. .

The company is "happy with the prod-
uct." and wants to test s few marketing
messages. said David Fishel. a spokesman
for the MR Nabisco Holdings Corp. unit.
"We've done very extensive locus-group
testing, and we want toget one last look in
the marketplace before we really consider
selling." he said. atddinsr that the Chatter
nooga test won‘t involve selling Eclipse to
consumers.

Meanwhile. publioheaith officials say
Reynolds is assembling a group oi leading
tobacco opponents to brief them on the
technical details oi Eclipse. Ate time when
the nation's biggest cigarette makers are
fighting a move by the Food and BM
Administration to regulate tobacco. the
meeting appears to be an attempt by
Reynolds to deiuse opposition from to
bemooontrol forces against its unusual
nexvroquct.

State of Immtmity
And Personality

Tied to Cancer

Medical Tribune Report
CAREFREE, Aruz —The role of the emo-
tional state in association with malignant
disease has recently been sharpened to an
extent that enables a delineation of the
“cancer—prone personality.”

And what ultimately makes him sus-
ceptible to cancer may be a psychologi-
cally triggered alteration in his immune
defense.

Both views, and some supporting ex-
periments, were reported here at the 13th
anndal Science Writers Seminar of the
American Cancer Society.

The personality sketch was described by
Claus Bahnson, Ph.D., senior research
scientist at the Eastern Pennsylvania Psy-
chiatric Institute in‘Philadelphia, who for
more than 10 years has been testing and
interviewing hundreds of cancer patients
for comparison with normal persons and,
more recently, with coronary patients and

patients with a variety of other somatic
diseases.

In general, be said, the cancer patient
represses all unpleasant “affect states,”
such as anxiety, depression, hostility, or
guilt, much more effectively than. nor-
mals or other sick persons do. As might
be deduced from that, the cancer pa-
tient feels the least stress in his job, re-
cent stress of any kind, or psychic
anxiety and is furthest from the “pat-
tern A” associated with myocardial in-
farction (competitive, restless, anxiety-
laden).

From childhood the typical cancer pa-
tient recalls a life that was “bleak and un-
satisfying,” remembering mother as un-
loving and u’nprotecting and father as un-
protecting and undemanding. The upshot
is a person who conforms to social norms,
living “a formal, realistic, and common-
sense—oriented effective social and family
life unrelated to his basic needs for affec-
tion, warmth, and personal creativity.”

“The cancer patient is a nice guy,” Dr.
Bahnson said, and has great difﬁculty deal-
ing with or expressing anger.

Subjected to statistical analysis, the
“projection score” data on cancer patients
compared with normals and patients with
other ills indicated the cancer patients’ re-
pression of emotions was signiﬁcantly
greater than normals for all indices and
greater than that of any other patient in all
indices except guilt, where there was no
meaningful difference between cancer,
coronary, and other sick patients.

Dr. Bahnson said he currently is work—
ing with cancer specialists and immunolo-
gists in an effort to pin down a relationship
between affect and stress states and im-
mune reactions in cancer patients com-
pared with normals. As it stands now,‘he
said, on a purely empiric basis it should be
possible to screen psychologically a ran-
dom group of people and accomplish a 30
per cent improvement in forecasting
which members of the group are most
likely to develop cancer.

to the Department of Justice; it actually suggested that? our

It is to be hoped that the Caldivell letter. among other
factors, will impel the Warren commission to‘look deeply
into the Communist aspect‘of the assassination, and to sea
sist the attempts of such persons‘as Sen. J. W. Fulbright
(D—Alli.) to shift the blame to the so-called: radical night

to the John Biochi Society—a fact which should canry‘it‘s

Mario Andretli won his 66th career pole Saturday at Michigan International Speedway.

Andretti burns up track

BROOKLYN, Mich (AP) Mario Andretti
stole the show Saturday in time trials for Sun»
day‘s Marlboro 500, turning the fastest qualify~
ing Elfin—Wits history.

The 53-year-old Andretti took the pole posi»
tion for the 500>mile race with a blazing lap of
234,275 mph on a virtually perfect day at
Michigan International Speedway

Andretti‘s effort knocked Newman-Haas
Racing teammate Nigel Manseli’s 233.462 out
of the top spot and was considerably quicker
than the 232.618 lap by Roberto Guerrero in
1992 at Indianapolis that had stood as the
fastest official qualifying lap until Saturday,

The record-smashing lap on the bumpy 2-
mile, high-banked oval was not quite as quick
as the hand-timed unofficial Indy-car closed-
course record of 234.5 set by Jeff Andretti, the
younger of Mario’s two racing sons. during a
test session Feb. 23 at Texas World Speedway.

“1 was a little worried about how things
were dragging today,"'Andretti said, “Things

 

 

weren’t going off on time and I was afraid the
track conditions would deteriorate if we wait-
ed too much longer. But it seemed like ev-
eryone was running a little faster than this
morning (in practice), so I just held my breath
and went for it.

“’F‘he track was great," he added. “The only
thing that would have made it better is if it
had been overcast."

Mansell already had qualiﬁed on the warm,
calm and sunny afternoon, breaking Andretti‘s
track qualifying mark of 230.150, set last year.
So Andretti, who upped his Indy-car record to
66 career poles, knew he had his work cut out
for him,

"I attacked the track from the word go,” the
four—time series champion said. “We needed
to build momentum and reach the speed."

By The Mammal: Pm”

Michael Andretti hopes a turnaround
for his season came along with a domi-
nating victory Sunday in the Toronto
Molson-lndy.

If it did, though, Andretti says the
reason is probably of! the track, where
Chip Ganassi Racing recently signed
veteran lndyCar engineer Mo Nunn to
help get things sorted out.

Whatever made the difference,
though, the 31-year-old Andretti was
able to outrace a variety of troubles
Sunday to end Team Penske’s seven-
race winning streak and earn his
fourth Toronto victory.

Andretti, whose best finish since an
opening-day victory in Australia was
fourth place last month at Milwaukee,
took control after bumping and passing
Nigel mnsell for the lead on lap 26 as
the defending series Champion's right-
rear tire deﬂated.

“I was staying right on Nigel," Andret-
ti explained. “I tried to get past him
once and almost wound up Ln a tire
barrier. Then i tapped him a little and
Just got by him a few turns later. I
didn't know he was having any problem
with his tire. i didn’t see that.”

Andretti was virtually unchallenged

heating Bobby Rahal to the finish by 6.8
seconds in earning his 29th career Indy-
Car victory.

“This is a big win for us,” Andretti
said. “We started out on a real high
with the win in Australia, then every
thing went downhill. It seemed the
harder we worked. the slower the car
would go.

“We needed a change and we were

fortunate that Mo Nunn left Simon Roc—
ing (last month). We went out and got
Mo to work with Julian Robertson, my
engineer all year long. They make a
super team. Hopefully, we‘re on the
way.”

Nunn was the chief engineer for Em-
erson Fittlpadli in his championship
season of 1989.

Geoff Bodine kept insisting that Koo
sler tires would withstand the rigors of
a long race. and proved it with what
amounted to a Sunday drive in the Mill»

The Victory at Pocono International
Raceway was the first this year for the
Indiana~based race tire manufacturer.
Cars running on the Goodyear brand
had won the first 16 races on the
NASCAR Winston Cup circuit.

“You‘re going to see a lot more ﬁne
sler cars in Victory Lane this year,‘
Bodine said. "We're proud of what (Kw
sier president) Bob Newton and his peo«
ple have done.”

Bodlne, who won the .pole in a Ford
Thunderblrd with a speed of 163.689
mph, led 156 of 200 laps and beat Ward
Burton by 1.26 seconds for his first vic-
tory this season. it was the 14th win of
Eodlne's career.

by Kurt Busch in a Ford. His run
of 177.848 mph in 40.484 seconds
topped the 173.561 mph, 41.484
lap ofAndy Houston last year that
won the pole.

Houston. who will move into the
NASGAR Winston Cup Series
along with Bustih next year, was
second fastest. He pushed his
Chevrolet. around the track in
41.045 seconds at 175.417 mph.

Others Who went faster than
Houston’s record were Dennis Set»
zer and David Starr, the fastest of
the Dodges, and the Fords driven
by Mike Wallace, Greg Biﬂle and

. Rick Crawford,

“Our strategy is to ﬁnish second
in points," said Busch, who’s batr
tling for the spot along with Hous-
ton and Wallace. “We am planning
to stay as close to the front as we
can and put a conservative setup
on it where we can be comfortable
in the draﬁ.

ing out with the No 60 (Houston)
and ND. 2 (Wallace) trucksf

Hodston said his'team made a
mock run at the pole.

“The truck is running pretty
well.” said Houston, who’s won the
last two NCTS poles at Fatima. “1
think We have a real good shot at

trying to sit on the pole, This being

my last truck race, it would be good

. to go out a winner.” _

“Smokers Find Qlly in‘Maryland Legislature

“By TOM STUCKEY=

Aassociated Press Writer=
QNNQPOLIS, Md. (RP) _ After years of watching their right to light

up slowly whittled away, smokers are about to get some relief from
the Maryland General Assembly. A
The legislature is nearing enactment of a bill that would make it
illegal for employers to refuse to hire someone because that person
is a smoker. Both the House and Senate are on record as supporting
the measure, making it likely a bill will be sent to the governor
before the legislature adgourns April 1%.
Gov. William Donald Schaefer has not taken a position on the issue.
Bruce C. Bereano, lobbyist for The Igbacco Institute, said he knows
of no other state that has a similar law, although the Virginia
legislature voted this year to prohibit discrimination‘by state and
local governments against smokers.
Identical bills introduced in the Maryland House and Senate go much
further than the Virginia law, covering all private employers as well
as public agencies. Rn employer could not refuse to hire or promote a
worker or fire him simply because that employee smokes when he is not

at work.

GDISUIEB 'SWIIDLES—Vll

    

"Stop smoking in only three days. No will
power or self control necessary. Proved effective
beyond a question in 100 per cent of smokers
tested.

"Don’t confuse .this offer with plans, systems,
books. methods, etc., for these remedies require
that you have enough‘self-control to stop smok-
ing."

All you do, the ad says, ‘is take one “Formula
X22" pill following each meal. After only three
days, your nervous system is "fooled” into be-
lieving you are smoking your favorite cigaret,
cigar of pipe.

This sort of promotion has been mushrooming
all over the U. S. since the Surgeon General's re-
port on smokingand cancer was released early in
1964. Since January, Better Business Bureaus
throughout the ‘country have been ﬂooded with
inquiries about dozens of "new" anti-smoking pills
and lozenges, mouthwas'hes and chewing gums,
stop-smoking plans and programs costing up to
$40 and more for “the cure."

Fanciful claims by manufacturers for their
products and programs include "miracle ingredi-
ents” supposed to be “99 per cent effective" and
to “force you to quit? whether you want to or not."
New commercial “tobacco guidance centers" with
lofty-sounding names have sprung up from coast
to coast—only a few of them under competent
medical supervision.

’ﬁ 6‘ ¥

Millions of us are paying millions of dollars
for products we hope will rid us painlessly of the
cigaret habit.

We are gulping sugar pills and concoctions of
ordinary spice such as ginger, licorice, clove, cori-
ander—as well as pharmaceutical preparations-—
to stamp out? the cigaret craving.

We are taking up fake cigarets—dubbed
“smokes” or “adult paciﬁers” which contain
such non-nicotinic ingredients as methol srystals,

 

cabbage, lettuce or just ﬂavored clgaret paper-—
to keep our nervous hands busy and permit us to
"smoke without fear.”

We are falling for suggestive “stop smoking"
phonograph records, recently the subject of in-
vestigation by the U. S. Post Ofﬁce.

= We are enrolling in a wide variety of so-called
“positive thinking" programs. even hypnosis. to
spirit us away from tobacco. We are devouring
no-smoke tablets and how-to-st‘opLsmoking pam-

phlets.

Justwhatisﬂievalueofthesepﬂlsandpnr
motions? What can and can't they do? From
the National Better Business Bureau’s Dr. Irving
Ladimer, here are a few straight answers:

Despite the welter of new labels. there are no
really “new” substances on the market to help
us stop smoking. 01d ones simply have been
dressed up or combined to appear new;

The three standard types of anti-smoking
medications now available are the nicotine sub-
stitute (lobeline sulfate), which alleviates cigaret
craving; substances Which make smoking taste
unpleasant (silver nitrate), and local anesthetics
(benzocaine) which numb the mouth and reduce
desire for.tbe pulling part of the smoking ritual.

Many. of these products do, in fact, help you ,

quit smoking temporarily. But none does the job
permanently. None works without a generous
dose of will power on your part. Most are harm-
less, but a few cases of nausea, stomach .pain and
loss of appetitite have been reported as side-
effects.

In conclusion, the American Medical Assn. .

states: “It is possible that some individuals amen-
able to psychological suggestion would find antic
tobacco preparations to be an aid. However, ex-
cessive smoking is a psychiatric problem and
must be treated as such if the individualis unable
to rid himself of-the habit voluntarily.‘

All Lip Service
. . Little Action

 

Several years ago the U. S; Surgeon General made
an announcement about the hazards of cigarette smoké
ing and the connection with cancer. The Medica‘ll'ffo-
fession has linked smoking with cancer and poor health,
and a small‘ TV advertising campaign has been sug-
gesting that cigarettes are a health hazard.

Congress passed weak legislation requiring the fol-
lowing words be printed on every cigarette pack: "Cau—
tion: Cigarette Smoking May Be Hazardous To Your

Now the Public Health Service has released an-
other report on smoking. The release says that a heavy
cigarette smoker may be shortening his life by eight
years if he continues the habit. In addition to calling
the cigarette habit the main cause for lung cancer. the
report said the habit can: contribute to the develop-
ment of fatal heart disease. ~

This is the first time that the PHS has linked heart
coronaries to cigarette smoking in an official report.
Secretary Wilbur Cohen of the Health. Welfare, and
Education Department suggested to Congress the words
on cigarette packages Should be changed to: “Warning:
Cigarette smoking is dangerous to health and may
cause death from cancer and other causes.”

The FTC went a step further and suggested that
cigarette advertising should be prohibited on television.

It is obvious the big money interests of the Cigar-
ette Industry will prevent any substantial action by the
Congress. The politicians will‘ use the same excuse that
was used here in Massachusetts recently in regard to
billboard advertising.

A bill to curb billboard advertising b'r giving the
towns and cities vé't'o’ power was killed‘ because state
representatives argued it would put a lot of people out
of work. This same weak excuse will undoubtedly be
used in CongreSS in regard to cigarettes . . . despite the

far more important consideration of the health and wel-
fare of the people.

The human being is weak. and the only way cigar-
ette smokers are going to quit the habit is through
some kind of prohibition. All the verbal and written

’ warnings in the world will not? curb smoking. Those

with the habit know it's unhealthy but haven't the will
to stop. I ‘am no exception.

The Medical Profession tells people they should
not smoke. and many doctors tell their patients they
should quit smoking..But the hollow words fall on deaf
ears because the medical authorities do not practice
vhat they preach and are really doing little to help
people quit the habit.

If cigarettes are really a health hazard. it is time
that health and medical leaders stopped the "lip serv-
ice" and do something about it, Actioni speaks louder
than words.

You can still buy cigarettes in hospitals,
You can still buy cigarettes in drug stores.

And inmost medical centers and doctor's offices,

" you can stilli smoke in the waiting rooms. And; many

doctors who speak against cigarettes are smokers them-
seIVes.

You can’t buy poisonOUS drugs in drug stores with-
out a prescription. and you certainly can‘t get them in
a hospital. Alli materials that may be iniurious totone 5
health in a hospital are locked up . . . alll except Cigar-
ettes!

Perhaps it’s time for the Sergeant General. Public
Health Service. Federal Trade Cmnmisqen. and all
medical authorities to fish or cull bail. Hillier take l“:4|
action or stop pussy-footing around with n moutlr full
of words without teeth,

was approved by the students
Thursday in a 498-to-406 vote.
. The ban, which applies-on
campus and within a two-
block area of the school, was
instituted by the principal on
October 2, on recommenda-
tion of the student council.

Cigarette advertising had
accounted for' 9.27/3 of the
Daily’s total advertising reve-
J nue. In national advertising.
.' cigarette and tobacco ads
C totalled 31%. ~

Paul Fitzgerald, business
manager of the Daily said all
but one of the manufacturers
(Marlboro cigarettes) have
cancelled their adVertising.
Fitzgerald said that the Marl-
boro Co., had an advertising
contract with the Daily fer
the rest of the year.

According to Fitzgerald.
the lost revenue will be
made up by raising local ad~
vertising rates and increas-
ing the amount of local ad-
vertising. The increase
would be about 5 per cent.

smoke at home only: 33.8% reported no
exposure at all. and 3.1% reported expo-
sort: a: both home and work.

The JAMA study otters strong evidence
that people tend to understale their expo—
sure to passive smoke. Then is a wide gap
between nonsmokers who say they are

exposed to tobacco smoke — 37% or adults
and 43% of children - compared with the
87.9% whore cotlnine shows they are ex-
posed. This gap i: significant because most
previous studies of workplace passive
smoke expomire. many at them funded by
the tobacco industry. relied on survey data
rather than blood samples. .

Even though the iludy found that more
nonsmokers are exposed to tobacco smoke
at work than at home, the sandy makes
clear mat the manual nicotine absorbed
into a nonsmoker‘s bloodstream is likelier
to hohigherlfone liveowilha smoker than
it one works with one. Nonmkers ex»
posed to tobncm athome had roughly twice
as much moraine in their blood as non

   

  
      
   

smokers exposed to tobatxo at work.

The federal Occupational Health and
Salon; Adnuntstraoou has ampliﬁed a reg-
ulation that would ban virtually all smok-
ing in the workplace. But the agency has
moved slowly in issuing a. ﬁnal rule - it
isn't expected this year - partly because
agenw officials are combing through a
mountain of public comments and partly
because oi budget cuts. The new ﬁndings
were made available to OSHA heiore its
oommentporiod on the smolonzrule ended
in milivlanmry. '

The Environmental Protection Agency
declared passive smoke a carcinogen
nearly four years ago. butmeh- finding has
stirred some controversy in the scientiﬁc
community. A recent report by the Corr
zressional Research Service expressed
such uncertainty on the topic that advo-
cute: {or and against lobaom both claimed
vindication tram it.

But James Firkin. the study‘s lead
author, yesterday said the new ﬁndings
are “much better data than the (1R5 report
ever looked at." '

But Brennan Dawson. a spokeswoman
for the Tobaroo Institute. said oi the JAMA
findings. “it‘s not a healthefiects sway."
She amid the study focused on nicotine
exposureasmeesurod in “molecules.“ and
that the source at these trace amoums
might be certain foods, such as tomatoes or
pommes, or a momentary whiff" of to-
barm smoke.

‘, ' Discovery ls Already in Use, With
Promising Results, in Treating
line Widespread Disorder

 

 

By HAROLD M. SCHIV‘EECK 5r,

A common dietary substance found in ‘

eggs, meat and fish has surprisingly di-
rect and almost immediate effects on
brain function, scientists at Massachu.
settvs Institute of Technology have found.

Their discovery has already been used,
with promising results, in treating one
widespread and disabling brain disorder.
Research is in progress to see if the com-
mon food substance called choline might
also be‘ useful in other brain conditions,
including depression and the memory de-
-i‘ects that are an important factor in se-
nillty.

All of these efforts stem from the dis-
covery a few years ago that choline
passes into' the blood from food in the

, digestive tract, is taken up direotl by
the brain from the circulating bloogand
is used to help the brain make an impor-

. tent chemical transmitter of nerve sig-

' nals. On an hour—to-hour basis the
amount: of the nerve signal transmitter
in the brain seems to depend on how

' much choline-rich food the individual has
eaten recently. .

“This is very strange," said Dr. Richard
3'. Wurtrnan at an interview in his labora-
tory in Cambridge. Mass, "because it
means that the composition of each meal
will directly affect the synthesis of
chemical signals in the brain." '

For years it had been generally believed
that something called the blood-brain
barrier protected the brain from direct
effects of substances either lacking or

«excessive in a: day-to-day dict. Only a
few things, notably alcohol and some

powerful drugs such as the narcotics, ’

were thought to be exceptions.
Gaps in the Barrier

Recent discoveries show that the blood
. brain: barrier has more gaps than had
beenthought. Thus, the person who eats

* ‘ll Willem a few hours have n

tcr sec ouetyichciine in the brain.

This, according to Dr. Wurtman, will
mean an amplification of the nerve sig-
nals sent from one nerve cell to the next
by those cells that use «acetylcholine for
the signaling.

The possible effects of this on behavior
are being studied. ,

Last fall, Dr. Wurtman and three cal-

reporting that nine patients fed chohne

- Some Believed More Complex
One patient’s symptoms were made

worse and 10 others showed no change. ‘
. Dr. Wurtman believes this indicates that

the group of patients included some
whose conditions stemmed from some
thing more complex than the classic taro
dive dyskinesie. ' .

, In current studies, the group in Boston
is substituting the choline-rich food sub-

other properties useful in commercially
prepared cakes, gravies. salad dressings,
beverage mixes and chocolate~coverccl
candies. Commercial lecithin contains
about 2 percent to 4 percent choline, Dr.

‘ Judith Wurtman estimates.

No comparable hypotheses have arisen
yet from .the choline studies. but scien-
tists at several institutions are studying
possible ways in which this chemical can

‘ be used to help the human brain.

Pursuing a clue concerning the chamb—
try of memory, for example, Dr, David

‘ Drachman of the University of Massachlo

set/cs at Worcester, is trying choline as
a possible help in preventing memory loss
among persons suffering from certain
kinds of senility.

Following another clue, Dr. John Davis

of the University of Chicago has been,
Pasting the effects of choline in two‘

major types of mental illness, the some-
times related manic and depressive
states. He is working on the hypothesis
that both conditions result from derange-
ment of a balance between two important
nerve signal transmitters, norepinephrine
and acetylcholine, with choline too high
in depression and norepinephrine too
high in mania. -

Risk of infant

that no smoke IS safe smoke

Anti-abortion activists
concerned with the well-
being of fetuses should per-
haps start supporting anoth- ‘
er group of protesters — the
opponents of secondhand '
smoke.

Roughly onefourth of -
American women smoke 1'0"

while pregnant and perhaps SIEOFRIED
as many as half of nonsmok-

ing pregnant women are exposed to the smoke of
others. Nicotine from this smoke makes its way to
the fetus. and medical researchers baVe document-
ed several damaging consequences. Nicotine expo-
sure has been linked to a higher rate of spontaneous
abortions. lower birth weights and a higher rate of
attention deficit disorder.

Furthermore. a study published this month
found a substantial increase in Sudden infant Death
Syndrome (commonly known as “crib death”)
among infants exposed to smoke before birth.

SIDS kills more than 5,000 babies per year in the
United States; more babies betwaen the age of 1
month and 1 year die of SIDS than from any other
cause. The causes of crib death have long been
mysterious — and in fact. part of the definition of
SIDS is that the death. is unexplained But while the

' unknown causes of SIDS aren't likely to be simple,
cigarette smoke seems to be a factor. '

Smoking by mothers. fathers or other people in
the same room with a baby greatly increases the crib
death risk. researchers from the University of Cali-
fornia. San Diego, reported last month in the Jour-
mil of the American Medical Association.

“The greater the total number of cigarettes the
infant was passively exposed to after birth from all
adulm. the higher the risk of SIDS." wrote Hillary
Sandra Klonoff-Cohen and colleagues.

Furthermore. smoke raises the risk of SIDS even
when the exposure comes before birth. When fa-
thers smoked in the presence of a nonsmoking
mother during pregnancy. for example, the risk of
infant crib death more than tripled. if the mother
smoked during pregnancy, the risk was even great-
er. the researchers found.

of course. such research represents only an in-
dictment of cigarette smoke as a baby killer and not
yet a conviction. for a correlation is not proof of a
causeiand-effect relationship. Still. other research
has begun to show evidence of how nicotine might
do direct damage to the developing fetal brain.

Dr. Elders attacks
the demon weed

Surgeon General of the United

States, did not castrate her hus-
band ortry to cripple an Olympic ath-
lete. Had she done so, the press con-
ference she held last week to
announce yet another escalation in
the federal war against smoking and
indeed against the demon weed in all
its forms might have enjoyed some
momentary notice in the nation’s
press. As it is, however, all Dr. Elders
threatens to do is strip the country of
yet another level of liberty, and that
seems not to be worthy of much pub-
lic attention.

That’s a shame, because of all the
wacky animals in the Clinton zoo,
Dr. Elders is surely the wackiest,
and whatever she says is sure to
split a rib. Her nutty comments

It’s too bad that Dr. Joyce Elders,

 

The irony of tlu's gala
unveiling is that it
comes from the same
woman who has just
counseled th'e
legalization of real
drags. .

rival even those of Vice President Al
Gore, who has run the gamut of
boobism 'from his tour of Thomas
Jefferson’s home at Monticello last
year, when he was unable to identi-
fy a bust of the third President of the
United States, to his mistranslatlon
a couple of weeks ago of the motto
“E Pluribus Unum” on the Great
Seal. Mr. Gore thinks the Latin
expression means “From One,
Many,” though in fact it means the
exact opposite, “From Many, One.”

Yet so far Mr. Gore’s bloopers,
unlike those for which Dr. Elders has
become notorious, have not endan-
gered liberty and public decency.
Only last month, the Surgeon Gener-
al earned a rebuke from the zoo mas-
ter-in-chief himself when she rumi-
nated on the virtues of legalizing
drugs. But last week she preached on
the evils of tobacco, and perhaps the
highlight of her sermon was her
deathless insight that “Any form of
tobacco — smoked, chewed, spit or
inhaled — is lethal.”

 

Samuel Francis, a columnist forThe
Washington Times, is nationally syndi-
caté’d- His column appears here Tues-
day and Friday.

 

That, of course, is simply non-
sense. There are untold millions of
people who smoke, chew or inhale
tobacco and don’t die from it. There
are people who
use tobacco a lit-
tle. There are peo-
ple who use it fora
while and give it
up. There even
are people who
smoke it heavily
for decades and
die quietly at 93
when they fall
down the kitchen

‘

Samuel stairs. For none of
. these people is the
Francis use of tobacco
“lethal” or even

harmful.

The purpose of the press confer-
ence was to arouse a somnolent citi-
zenry to action, and it was only a pre-
lude to the surgeon general’s
forthcoming magnum opus on smok-
ing, due in February. While Dr.
Elders was blasting the tobacco
industry, ex-President Jimmy Carter,
whom Dr. Elders dragged forth as an
ornament for her performance,
urged a $2-per-pack tax increase on
cigarettes to help keep “3,000 chil-
dren from trying cigarettes, for the
ﬁrst time each day.” Whenever you
hear the Word “children,” you should
quietly rip the cellophane on your
pack of Chesterﬁelds.

Then Dr. Antonia Novello, Sur-
geon General under President Bush,
unbosomed the bizarre sentiment
that tobacco is “the least regulated
consumer product” in the country.

But it’s already illegal in most
states for minors to buy tobacco prod-
ucts, and smoking is banned inall air-
planes and many airports, restau-
rants, malls and public buildings, on
top of outlawed cigarette advertising
on TV and radio, compulsory warning
labels and taxes that are already pro-
hibitive. For Dr. Novello to pronounce
that tobacco is “the least regulated”
product in the country is — once
again — an outright lie.

The plan is to push for virtual
prohibition of tobacco by the year
2000, and the Coalition on Smoking
or Health, which also bellied up to
the Surgeon General’s pulpit last
week, had the details. The Food and
Drug Administration should ban
the claims that low-tar and low-
nicotine cigarettes are less danger-
ous than the good stuff. The Feder-
al Trade Commission should ban
“Joe Camel” ads that supposedly
entice children to smoke. The
Transportation Department should
make international ﬂights smoke-

less. Congress should impose the
$2-a-pack taxand give the FDA full
authority to regulate all tobacco
products, and so on.

The irony of this gala unveiling of
yet another therapeutic war to be
waged by the federal leviathan is that
it comes from the same woman who
has just counseled the legalization of

real drugs. Since Dr. Elders’ own son ,

is facing felony drug charges and her
husband owns a house in Little Rock
notorious as the hang-out of a whole-
some collection of youths known as
the “8 Ball Posse,” suspected of drug-
dealing themselves, it ought to strike
most Americans as just a bit ripe for
this sanctimonious loudmouth to blus-
ter lies and banalities about tobacco
even as she croons the virtues of
legalizing dangerous substances.

But then, the American ruling class
has never been known to stint itself in
the pursuit of other peoples’ vices,
especially when there’s power to be
had in the chase. If nothing else, Dr.
Elders’ unnoticed press conference
was a pure specimen of what that
class is up to and how it plans to
achieve it — unless the citizens can
tear themselves away from Lorena
Bobbitt and Tonya Harding long
enough to protect what remains of
their freedom.

The crop is a moneymaker for
the country. Since 1940. taxes on tobacco
produCts have brought in more than $129
billion dollars.

It supports small farms. The average
tobacco farm covers less than 136 acres.

Tobacco farms are efﬁcient. They

The structure. however — the small
farms. the cooperativs. the warehouses
and work organizations -— will remain.
And if anyone has a shred of sense. the
web of farms and co-ops that have held

That can happen. At least. that’s what
a group of farmers. we“economists and burley
cooperative laders thought when they
nrst gathered lastspttng at a meeting
mlled by Beres’s Community Farm Alli-
ance Since then. the group has been
knitting together pieces of the future.

The group has produced the outline of
a plan. a 27 page document being quietly
arculated around the South. lrorumily, the
proposal depends on the Clinton health
plan. the one that calls for a massive new
m on tobacco. Part of that money could
(should. farmers say) go back to tooacco
counties. Depending on which proposal
vtnds up in the Clinton packages. tobacco
counties could receive more than $1 billion
a year.

So this is the question: Given $1 billion
a year. how an tobacco farmers and
communities build new economies? How
can tobacco counties survive as the de-
ntand for tobacco slackens?

The study doa not claim there is any
single crop that can replace tobacco. Too
much time has been wasted on this tie
bate. There isn’t any new miracle crop.
The best the government can do is set up
a system where innovative farmers and
communities can ﬁnd new ways to use
their assets to make money.

"Regarded the FCC ban as 'an unwarranted. ill-advised

"'1 regard the proposal of the Federal Communications
emission for a ban on advertising of cigarettes through
television and radio media as an unwarranted, ill-advised
and improper effort to extent government control over
business and industry by administrative dictation.

"'It is an extention of earlier efforts. successfully
resisted so far by Congress, by both the Federal Trade
Commission and the FCC to exercise control over the
tobacco industry beyond the extent of their authority
and in an area properly reserved for legislative
jurisdiction.”

"Said he knew of no legal authority by which FCC
could enforce its proposed ban on broadcast cigarette

advertis ins."
(UPI 2/5/69)

"Forecasting early hearings 6n the issue, offered a
critical cement that seemed to reflect a conunon
'attitude on the part of committee m-bers.

"' I think some of the regulatory agencies are doing some
of these things the wrong way.

“They've been guilty of it before--taking a stand
of this kind on an issue which they know the Congress
would probably be considering shortly. I don't think
Congress likes this approach-wand that is without
regard to the particular issue of cigarette smoking.”

Relatively unpollutcd air may give

Just how much of a problem

lung cancer is in Morgan County.
compared to what it is in other

. areas. is brought outi in a new

report by the U. 5. Public Health
Service.

The report appears at a time
when considerable attentit‘m is
being givenito the possibility that
air pollutioniis the cause of much
of the lung cancer that has been

lung cancer. Meanwhile, munici-
palities in many parts of the coun
try have passedi ordinances see|d~
ing to reduce the amount of air
pollution.

Not that cigarette smoking has
been given any.cleanibill of health.
The national Canceri lnstituic

According to the offiCia in -
ings, there were 35 deaths from
cancer of all types among residents
of Morgan County in the year end
ing January. 1960.

Of the 35. however. lung can-
cer was responsible for only 3, on
8.6 per cent of the total.

Generally; throughout the United
States. lung canceri amounted to
14.4 per cent of the overall can-
cer mortality, and, in the State
of Indiana. to 13.7 per cent..

Whether on not cigarette smok-
ing is a major or minor cause
of long cancer. there is evidence
thati points to air pollution as a
lung irritanti and an important
malefactor.

Air Pollution

Benzyprene. which is also foundi
in cigarette smoke. is an airborne
pollutant that is under suspicion
It comes from the smokestaclts ofi
factories and homes and from the
exhausts of automobiles.

to determine whether there is a
cause and effect relationship be-
tween such industriali smog and

cancer death among men. The '
number of male deaths attributed
‘to it has multiplied six times in
the past 20 years.

The current report shows that
Morgani County now has a lung
cancer mortality rate of 8.9 per
100,000 population.

 

This compares with a rate of

20.9 per 1001000) for the United

‘Plane’ Speaking
on Cabin Air Quality

The problem of Indoor air quality
it one of growing concern inter-
nationally. We spoke with Dr. Larry
Holcomb. a Michigan biologist who
specialize: in toxic hazard inverti-
gatianafor government agencies and
Industry. about one/acct ofthia prob-
lem — cabin air quality on common
clot airplanca. Holcomb recently
completed a comprehensive study on
cabin air quality that war published
in Environmental 'icchnoiogy Let-
ters. a :cicntiﬁejoumal.

Q: What are some of the com-
ponents of poor airplane cabin air
quality and their impact?

A: A major factor it low relative
humidity. which can drop from 40 to
70 percent to 5 to l0 percent when
cold. dry air it brought into the air-
craft at night altitude and heated for
circulation. This drop can retult in
eye irritation and dryness of nasal
passages and the respiratory tract.

Another factor it ozone brought
into the cabin with outside air. Ozone
has been araocieted with eye discom-
fort. cheat pain or tightneta.
breathing difﬁculty. natal irritation.
persistent coughing and auto throat.
'nie aymptomr of there two factors
often are mistakenly reported an
“allergic" reactione.

'lhnperature. barometric pressure
and turbulence also cause discomfort
to passengers. Even piling too much
luggage under the airplane teat can
contribute to discomfort by blocking
ventilation porta.

Qt la the public await-e of what
causes dleeomfort while ﬂying?

At Moat putengera are not aware
thattheairitaadryu itieorofpoa.
eibie ozone inﬂuencee. it it very
common to blame any discomfort on
environmental tobacco smoke be~
cause it it the only thing that you tee.

'l‘hit mitperceprion has been fueled
in large part by the publicity eur-
munding any mention of tobacco. in
fact, any of the aymptornr anociated
with poor cabin air quality can be
caused by low relative humidity.
ozone ut the other factor: I
mentioned.

Airliner. at their discretion, can
provide nu active tumor of ﬁltered
fresh air. 'lhere'e no evidence that
environmental tobacco amoke ad-
versely affects the health of non-
emoldng passengers and crew.

Qt Will banning smoking on
commercial airlines eolve the
problem» associated with poor
cabin air quality?

A: Much think it will tolve any
problems" in fact, it could even prove
disadvantageous by providing a false
sense of security to the passenger:
who might believe that because they
aren‘t seeing amoire. they are better
off, when actually they are not.

Q: What can be done to im-
prove cabin air quality?

A: if good ventilation and will-
cient air ciunzet are provided. then
ventilation should be euflicient.
Alto. aircraft should be equipped
with catalytic converter: to remove
ozone; those that are already
equipped should be properly maln-
taincd. Some aircraft manufacturers
are beginning tohuiid aircrait that re-
circulm air. This it more likely to
cauu atmiidup of contaminants.

Focusing on then very real cauaea
of poor cabin air quality will go a
long with toward correcting the

t

problem.
