WEEKLY HIGHLIGHTS
AUGUST 8 — 14, 1989

* Mainstream and sidestream ’TPM’ fractions from the Beta 90
nicotine and glycerol fate in total smoke studies have been
combined and concentrated in preparation for determination of
levels of intact starting materials (percentage of radioactivity
that is due to unchanged nicotine or glycerol). This is a tedious
process because care has to be taken not to lose any
radioactivity during concentration.

* Experiments have been designed, solutions prepared and time
scheduled to determine the fates of nicotine and glycerol in 3
more Beta 90 protocepts. These studies will start on 8/15/89.

* Currently consulting with Bill Needs to determine the best
statistical approach for evaluation of the data already obtained.

Dear Tom:

I am writing to you about 3 "Dear Colleague" letter that you
sent on August 4 regarding H.R. 3434.

I am not surprised, of course, that we disagree on this
Issue. I am surprised and disappointed, however, that you have
taken such a personal tone in your criticism. There is no
substantiva argument in the Nickie chherter column excerpt you
circulated to our colleagues; instead, it is a mean—Spirited
attack on my character and reputation.

I have come to expect these tactics from the tobacco
companies, but not from you. I am sorry you saw fit to respond
to our disagreement over H.R. 3434 in this way.

Sin ely,

DATE: November 16, 1988

SUBJECT: Review of Research Suggestions from James Crapo

The following is a review of the research suggestions made by Dr.
James Crapo. This review has been developed in collaboration

with A. Mosberg and C. Coggins:

.I. Evaluation of Cardiovascular Effects
1. Vascular Reactivity of the Coronary
circulation

Determine acute coronary vasculature spasm in
models such as dogs, primates and possibly
man produced by reference cigarette smoke,
new cigarette smoke and nicotine.

2. Vascular Reactivity of the Cerebral
Circulation

Changes in cerebral circulation can be
determined by near infrared spectroscopy
using animal models such as the cat and
baboon and possibly man. The effect of
reference cigarette smoke, new cigarette
smoke and nicotine can be determined.

Critique

9 Dr. Crapo suggest factors such as
pyrolysis products, CO and nicotine
can have an effect on these
variables. The studies as outlined
do not adequately separate out
which factors (if any) may produce
observed effects (if any).

Re: Grant No. 1683A

Dear Dr. Gauldie:

The Council for Tobacco Research, USA, Inc. is pleased to award you a continuation
grant in the amount of $76.258.00 for .the period from July 1, l987 to June 30, I988 for the
study proposed in your application “Fibroblast-Mast Cell Interaction in Inflammatory Lung
Disease.” It is understood that this grant is made subject to acceptance by institutional
authorities.

The award is made without guarantee of support beyond June 30, 1988, even though we
recognize that your application proposes a study extending two years beyond that date.
Therefore, if by November 30, 1987 you submit to us a formal renewal application, including a
report of your progress to date, your request will receive consideration.

Your attention is called to the enclosed "Important Procedural Information for
Grantees". Please fill in the attached “Notice of Research Project” and return it to me, Drs.
Harmon McAllister, Research Director, and David Stone, Associate Research Director, will
serve as your primary contact with our scientific staff on matters concerning your grant.

As Principal Investigator, you should know that CTR recovers unexpended balances at
the end of each grant year. We suggest that you personally keep an accurate record of
expenditures and commitments to assure that you agree with your institution’s official financial
statement at the end of the grant year. Please note that year-end deficits cannot be recovered
from CTR, even from funds awarded in a subsequent year. Finally, please be aware that our
failure to receive timely annual financial statements from your grants office will stop further
grant payments. Appropriate forms will be sent to your financial officer at the end of the
grant year, Administrative problems are relatively rare and we hope that this statement of our
fiscal policies will obviate any possible misunderstandings.

Dear Dr. Finkelstein:

Thank you for your interest in our program of research support. I am pleased to enclose
our Statement of Policy, Information for Applicants and a recent Annual Report that lists
currently supported grants and contains abstracts of papers that have appeared over the
last year acknowledging support from The Council for Tobacco Research.

Our two—step application process is described on a separate enclosed sheet; it addresses
several topics including eligibility, funding levels, award duration and speciﬁc
instructions for submitting a Preliminary Application. Each application is reviewed by
members of our Scientiﬁc Advisory Board, a panel of established biomedical scientists
who serve as our peer review committee.

Briefly, applicants must be faculty level scientists having appointments at not-for-proﬁt
institutions. The Council supports independent investigator—initiated projects (one, two
or three years) in a variety of biomedical research areas. In the event you receive an

award, annual, non—competing renewal applications are required and continued funding
is based on your progress and the materials you Submit with the renewal request forms.

The Council encourages proposals from younger researchers, but as you will see from
the Annual Report, a number of our awardees are established scientists. We ask that you
complete the enclosed " Current and Pending Support" form since some consideration is
given to your current funding level. Complete scientiﬁc freedom is assured and our only
expectation is publication of research results in appropriate peer-reviewed journals.

Sincerely,

Dear Dr. Wu:

Thank you for your expression of interest in our program of research support. I am pleased to
enclose a recent Annual Report that lists grants currently supported and a. brochure describing
policies of The Council. Our application procedure is a two-step process, comprising a
preliminary inquiry and, if that is approved, a final proposal . To accomplish the first step,
potential applicants should submit a brief (3 to 4 page) preliminary outline of the study for
which support is sought. It should contain the following information:

1. A synopsis of the project under investigation, its present goals and status.

2. A brief outline of plans and goals for the proposed research, specifying the next steps to be
taken. ,

3. Anticipated duration and annual direct costs of the study as proposed. Please note that The
Council will only provide support for a maximum of 3 years. Although grants are made for
one year at a time, up to two annual renewals can be considered on the basis of progress
reports and materials submitted with renewal applications. ,

It would also be helpful to have:

1. Brief curricula vitae and scientific bibliographies of the applicant and principal professional
level collaborators. The two-page NIH format is preferred for the preliminary inquiry.

2. One copy each of any two or three publications, abstracts or manuscripts that are closely
related to the project for which funding is being sought.

Preliminary inquires are evaluated by the Executive Committee of our Scientific Advisory
Board for scientific merit and for "fit" into The Council’s current multidisciplinary biomedical
research program. The reviewerseither encourage or discourage submission of a formal
detailed application for full competitive consideration. That process takes approximately two
months. If the vote is to encourage, then appropriate forms and instructions are provided.
Submission deadlines for M (not preliminary) applications are May 31 and November 30;

activation is typically seven months later.

Sincerely,

Additional perchlorates were assayed by the following procedure:
Approximately 0.5 g. of sample was weighed into a lOO-ml. volumetric
flask and dissolved in 10 ml. of water. This solution was diluted to
the mark with pyridine and 10 m1. aliquots were titrated potentio-
metrically with 0.1 N tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (BuaNOH).

The perchlorates of copper, cobalt, aluminum, zinc, manganese,
lead and strontium were successfully analyzed in this manner. Acetic
acid must be added to the aliquot prior to the titration of chromium

Comparison of Silastic 73lRTV Dana June 26, l974
and 732RTV Sealants

Mr. E. L. Hall Front Larry A. Lyerly
Machine Shop Research Department

Samples of the two sealants were removed from the tubes and allowed to
cure for several days. They were burned in special sample cells for analysis
by infrared spectroscopy. The pyrolysis products from the two samples appEared
to be the same although variations in intensities of the products occurred.
The infrared spectra of the vapor phases suggest the presence of small amounts ,
of hydrocarbons, carbon dioxide and monoxide, acetic acid, and with somewhat
larger concentrations of silicones. The residue after burning appears to be
essentially silicon dioxide (sand).

During our conversation about the sealants, you mentioned that 73lRTV had
been approved for your use as a gasket material. Accordingly, the results of
our analyses indicate that the 732RTV should be equally acceptable. I recommend
that neither material be used in places where contamination in tobacco would
likely occur. For example, use on moving machine parts where wear would result

in probable contamination in tobacco should be avoided.

Attached are data sheets received from Dow Corning regarding the status
of Silastic 732RTV under Federal Food and Drug Administration Regulations and
the National Sanitation Foundation. Note that when thoroughly cured and washed,
732RTV has been approved under FDA Regulation No. l2l.2562 dealing with rubber
articles intended for repeated use in contact with food. Under the NSF Code,
732RTV has been approved for use in the splash zone and 73lRTV in the food zone.

BRIGHT 85/100 Date: January H, 1983
19811 Flavor Development

12-. D. L. Roberts 1/ c From: R. F. McCarthy

The recent visit to Biddle Sawyer was very encouraging with regard to the
improved flavor components which were reviewed IOr the BRIGHT filter flavor

system. The deterpinated hearts of peppermint represent a giant step for-
ward in the fact that they will move us closer to a filter flavor system

which can be quantitatively/qualitatively monitored. Although we are at an
impasse at this time in being able to monitor the current filter flavor sys-
tem, it is imperative that we not lose sight of this objective in 1984. It
is requested that all filter flavor development work be directed toward
simplifying and reducing the number of flavor components added to the fil-
ter. A revised flavor system with only peppermint hearts in the filter
would be of the greatest interest in recognition of the current dilema of
not being able to monitor peppermint on our current products.

In addition to the present flavor improvement work which is currently under-
way, it is requested that the aforementioned approach be assigned a level of

importance and priority that is commensurate with any flavor improvement
work in 1984.

Please advise if there are any questions or concerns.

RE: Moviegoer - CAMEL Perspective

As requested, the following is Media's perspective on Moviegoer Magazine relevant
to CAMEL's continued support/usage in 1987.

BACKGROUND

.Hoviegoer was developed in 1982 by the 13-30 Corporation for exclusive use by the.
CAMEL brand. At that time, CAMEL was seeking a property that delivered impactful
impressions against better educated 18—34 year old males.' Both Brand and Media

management felt that Moviegoer could deliver this audience via high levels of
frequency/exposure in selected markets. Attached is the original authorization

request submitted on May 7, 1981, which outlines key brand objectives. '

The three major objectives of Moviegoer were: 1) reach portions of CAMEL's target
not reached by other magazines, 2) generate Brand association/sponsorship ruboff

and 3) heighten awareness/impact via an uncluttered environment.

A five—year contract (1982-1986) was negotiated at a beginning cost of $5.3MM per
year. In 1983, SALEM became a co—advertiser to help offset the impact on CAMEL's
budget. Rate increases have averaged 92 per year, and in 1986, the total Corporate
commitment will be $7.4MM ($4.8MM Media, $2.6MM Promotions). Circulation has

remained controlled at 1.2MM per year.

NEW PROPOSAL

Moviegoer has offered RJR a new three—year proposal (details attached). Briefly,

the total yearly cost will be $5.6MM net (versus $7.4MM in 1985). Issues will be
decreased from 12 to 10, the number of ad pages will be decreased from 60 pages (5

pages x 12 issues) to 52 pages (5 pages x 8 issues and 6 pages x 2 issues).
Circulation will increase 462 from 1.2MM to 1.7SMM in eight issues (and to 3.0MM
or 1502 for 2 issues). The number of markets will decrease from 127 to 100 (212).

CURRENT RESEARCH

During the last five years, several studies have been conducted regarding Moviegoer's

15

L881 88LOQ

readers. For purposes of this perspective, we will summarize key research data/findings

from these studies which we feel are relevant to our CAMEL perspective. Research
data summariZed are from the following sources: MDD's recent readership survey,
13-30'8 research and movie patron demographics/ findings from industry sources.

Subject: VANTAGE PACKAGING EXPLORATORY

 

Dear Howard:

As we discussed by telephone, we are requesting that you conduct
an additional phase of exploratory for VANTAGE packaging. You

should concentrate your work during this phase on VANTAGE Parent
85mm and VANTAGE Excel. Once this phase is successfully completed
we will proceed with translations to our VAT, Ultra Lights, 100's

and Menthol styles.

As we agreed, your initial presentation to us is scheduled for
12/17. Flats as opposed to comps are the appropriate format for
this presentation; however, they should have a high degree of

finished appearance.

Howard, direction for this next phase does not depart
significantly from that which guided your previous work. There
are, however, several areas upon which you should place additional
focus in order to achieve the optimal design for VANTAGE. Specif—
ically, you should strive to:

0 Increase the pack's contemporary look.
0 Provide a higher level of quality appearance.

0 Inject motion and energy into the design, as opposed to a
static effect.

0 Maintain a strong visual link to current VANTAGE packaging.
Specific design elements which you should address include:

0 Logo treatment which is more contemporary as regards typeface
or position.

RE: Case number 6705

Dear Dr. Hashim,

Enclosed please find the original and 6 copies of my application to the Council for Tobacco
Research titled, 'Growth factor-stimulated transcription of the MCP-I "slow"
immediate-early gene by novel 5' enhancer elements.’ This proposal requests 3 years
of funding from the Council and describes experiments which will characterize two critical control
elements operative in growth factor-stimulated transcription of the MCP-I immediate-early gene.
The M CP-1 gene (for monocyte chemoattractant protein-1) codes for the potent CC chemokine
MCP-l Which has been shown to play important roles in the initiation and progression of
atherosclerotic lesions The MCP—l protein can also be used in the adjuvant treatment of a number
of malignancies.

Success in the areas discussed in this application will yield new insights into novel signal
transduction pathways as well as a number of specific (DNA and protein) targets, important in
transcriptional control, for future rational drug design.

Thank you for your consideration of these materials

Subject: Promotion of Carr J. Smith, PhD.

It is with great pleasure that we announce Dr. Carr Srnith’s promotion to Senior Staff Scientist in
Research & Development. Carr has been with R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company since 1986,
performing a variety of critical ﬁrnctions for the Company. He has been in the Product Evaluation
Group since November 1992. Over the past eighteen months, his work in meeting the objectives

of the Product Evaluation Group, formerly the Biological Research Group, has been exemplary.
We are pleased to recognize Carr’s efforts with this promotion.

One of the major things that Carr has been able to accomplish in the brief time he has worked with
us is to initiate a program in the area of human cardiovascular disease. Carr has accepted the
challenge to build this program and has made signiﬁcant progress to reach his goal. He has
carefully reviewed the literature and written several review articles on the relationship between
smoking and cardiovascular disease. One major conclusion is that the cardiovascular risks of
smoking and nicotine use have been grossly exaggerated by individuals outside the Company.
These articles are being submitted for publication in peer reviewed journals. Additionally, Carr
has been actively involved in studies with smokers to support product development efforts.
Carr’s depth of knowledge in human clinical studies is invaluable to all of us. He has been a
critical participant in our continuing efforts to bring scientiﬁc rigor to the question of the health
effects of environmental tobacco smoke. Carr was actively involved in responding to the EPA
and he has a key role in our current attempts to educate OSHA on the scientiﬁc facts.

In summary, Carr Smith has been and is performing at a level consistent with the duties and
responsibilities of a Senior Staﬁ‘ Scientist at R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company. We are delighted
to have him as part of our team. We look forward to his continuing efforts to provide balance in
scientific discussions of the biological activity of tobacco smoke, particularly in the area of
cardiovascular disease. Please join us as we congratulate Carr on his achievements.

HEALTH CARE FREEDOMS INITIATIVE

April 9, 1996

Mark Nelson

RJ. Reynolds Tobacco Company
Public Affairs Counsel

PO. Box 12945

Salem. OR 97309

Dear Mr. Nelson

Cena’m industries in the United States, such as the tobacco industry, have been obligated to pay a
disproportionate share of publicly funded health care costs.

With an aging population and an increase in employer mandated health tnSuranoc requirements at
the state level. costs to the tobacco industry are destined to increase. Only drastic change: in the
health care delivery system can prevent this spiraling cost.

Market research indicates 90% of Oregonians want alternative medicine included in their health

plan, That is why the 1995 Oregon Legislature passul an alternative medicine bill. which was
limited in scope,

The New England Joumal of Medicine published a national study done by Harvard University, in
1993, which detcnnlnad that over one-third of Americans use some form of non-traditional health

care and pay for it out of their own pocket This will not change if managed care and insurance
companies have their way.

Meanwhile, proﬁt and not for-proﬁt forces have evenly pressured physicians into the unenviablc
function ofngrcial agent to inc-ruse the proﬁtability of health care organizations. This
subjective distortion of the physicran‘s obligation has put at risk the historical trust that is the
central element of the physician-patient relationship. Health care professionals are limingb'
fawd with the dilemma of choosing between patient welfare and the proﬁt of the health care
delivery system We believe this is neither good health care nor beneﬁcial to you and our society

That‘s why Oregonians haVe launched the Health Care Freedoms initiative ( HCFI ), which will:
0 help assure citizens‘ choice of category of health are provnier,
0 put the patient back into the consumer‘s role:

0 lower the overall cost of health care;

0 clear away many of the obstacles between patient and provider and once again allow the free
market to work

Dear Dr. Brady,

It was a pleasure to become acquainted with you at the recent
EASEB meeting in Atlantic City, and as you Suggested at that time, I am
rforwarding copies of my curriculum Vitae and list of publications.‘

Some preliminary studies in my laboratory in Australia resulted

in the recent publication of a paper in Nature entitled " Nicotine, Smoking

and Cortical Inhibition ", a copy of which is enclosed. I hopefully suggest

that this paper may contain some of the most significant suggestions about the

psychotrOpic actions of nicotine to have been published and further pursuit

of these experiments may lead to a greater understanding of the psychotropic

actions of tobacco smoke. A comparison of the actions of ordinary and

"de-nicotinised" cigarette smoke on neurones in intact and isolated cortical

areas would constitute a logical extension of my preliminary experiments. I shall
‘ be moving to Winnipeg later this year to head a neuropharmacology research group,

and should like to pursue these studies as suggested above. At a later stage,

I should envisage a collaborative series of experiments with colleagues in

the Psychology Department at Winnipeg.

If you consider that a project along these lines entitled " A
Comparison of the actions of nicotine and tobacco smoke on single neurones in
»the central nervous system" would be of interest to the Council for Tobacco
Research, I should be happy to submit an application for support.

As mentioned during our recent conversation, I believe that this
technique of recording from single neurones with multiple barrel electrodes,
with which it is possible to stimulate or inhibit cells chemically, provides
a powerful tool for unraveling problems of this nature.

With best regards,
Yours sincereky,

Egrpose

To compare True (L—11,942A) to a DORAL estron prototype (L-12,0598)
among Hi—Fi non—menthol smokers.

Test Method

A paired two cigarette mall intercept test was conducted by Dwight Spencer
and Associates. L-11,942A was compared to L- 12, 0593 by 60 Hi— Fi (less than 15 mg.)
smokers. These panelists were asked to rate each cigarette on ten smoking
attribute statements. The scores represent a range of 1 to 7, in which 4. 0 is
the mean. The lower the score the greater the agreement with the statement; and
the higher the score the greater the disagreement with the statement. Also,
the panelists were asked for overall preference and to compare each product to
their usual brand. The smokers were broken down into four groups.

Reynolds Smokers 3S & over

Dear Andre,

I have now managed to sit down and organize the

two projects which we are to offer for PILC work

with the Smoke/Technology Groups. I thought you
-would like to have details to be able to present

a more detailed programme at the meeting in Florence.

l. Nitrogen sources and nitrous oxide in smoke

We will have tobacco from three sources of nitrOgen,
ammonium nitrate, sodium nitrate and urea. This is
a properly replicated trial so we can give them up
to ten replications. '

2. Effect of sucker control compounds on leaf quality

We can supply up to four replications of cured leaf

treated with n—decanol, octonol decanol mixtures,
Prime Plus (CGA41065) Bud Nip (chlorpropham),

Accotab (pendimethalin), Tamex (butralin), FST-7
(n—decanol plus potassium salt of maleic hydrazide)
and several others.

From both these trials we will have yield and quality
figures and this could be supplemented by any figures
from Smoke group. Our tobacco will be available at the
end of April 1984.

I hope this will be useful in presenting your case in
Florence.

Yours sincerely,

Dear Ms. Gustafson:

I am writing to follow up on my letters of December 7, 1994 and January 6,
1995. I hope that you still are interested in exploring the possibility of a cooperative
effort to reduce underage smoking in Washington State through the application of a

combination of our RIGHT DECISIONS/RIGHT NOW and SUPPORT THE LAW
programs.

Further, during our December 5th meeting we discussed the JOE CAMEL
advertising for our CAMEL brand. You were not surprised when I indicated that,
at that time, we were not prepared to discontinue all use of our present campaign;
however I take this opportunity to reafﬁrm what I did tell you during that meeting.
Even though we are confident that CAMEL advertising does not cause anyone to
begin smoking, if you believe that there are speciﬁc actions which we could take in

order to have a real impact on underage smoking, we are prepared to discuss your
suggestions in good faith.

I look forward to hearing from you on either or both of these subjects.

Subject: Project Symphony Meeting

As we are postponing our Symphony meeting tomorrow, I wanted you to be aware of a
couple of issues that, in order to keep the ball rolling, we may want to address prior to
next Monday. Here is one item we wanted to discuss:

0 Diamond Shamrock - The issue here is to have everyone on board with the same plan.

I spoke today with R. P. Dotson, and H. J. Heintz in San Antonio. They had planned to
call Diamond Shamrock today (though did not get through) to resolve the issues with
Hogshead. HJ. was was able to set up an appointment with Jim Manning for this Friday.

As per discussions with David Owens last week, R. P and H. I. were going to propose
that Diamond Shamrock accept Hogshead and sell it in their generic branded savings
display, alongside Doral. They would not beneﬁt from the $0.50/carton deal. I do not
believe that would give Hogshead due chance for success.

According to RP, I am not sure with the merchandising contract we have with Diamond
Shamrock that we will be able to ‘force’ them into accepting the Hogshead display as
another footprint.

At a meeting today with Jim Helm, Kathryn Noxon and Michelle Soyars, we discussed the
idea of having Diamond Shamrock accept the temporary Hogshead counter display and
switch it out with existing RJR displays. For example, have the Hogshead display up for a
month instead of Dora], and for another month instead of Select, Camel, etc.

0 That leads to the idea of a test within a test - to determine exactly what impact having
full retailer support has on the success of the brand. Testing the success of Hogshead
with a retailer who does not support the brand, versus testing it with retailers who do,
i.e. full partners Circle K and NCS supporting the brand against a Diamond Shamrock
more conventional approach.

We could potentially have a similar situation in Pittsburgh, with UniMart. I just wanted
you to be aware of the situation, and wanted to hear your reaction/recommendation.

Dear Maurice,

The Ofﬁce of Technology Assessment (OTA), which is an arm of the U.S.
Congress, is preparing a report on the likely economic effects of a federally
mandated ban on smoking in virtually all buildings in the country. The legislation
would affect just about everyplace except one's home.

The OTA may be asking leaders of the hospitality industry for their input on
this proposal. They would be particularly interested in possible economic impact.
While there may not be any rigorous scientific studies of the economic effect of such
a proposal, I am certain you can understand the potential for great harm to your
members.

It is not out of the question to assume that many smokers would simply not
patronize restaurants and other hospitality venues at all, or at least with substantially
less frequency, if they are not permitted to smoke anywhere in the building. As I am
certain you agree, the marketplace is well situated to accommodate smokers and
nonsmokers without additional mandates from government at any level.

Should you be contacted by someone from OTA about this report they are
preparing, I would be grateful if you would let me know.

ILLINOIS WHOLESALER LETTER #3

October 12, 1993

Gale A Held, Director

State Prevention Systems Program
Center for Substance Abuse Prevention
Rockwell II Buildihg, 9th Floor

5600 Fishers Lane

Rockville, Maryland 20857

Dear Ms. Held:

As a wholesaler in Illinois, I am very disturbed about the Department of Health and
Human Services’ (HHS) proposed rules regarding the sale or distribution of tobacco
products to minors under Section 1926 of the Public Health Service Act. I would like to
take this opportunity to articulate some of my concerns.

As you may know, the Illinois state legislature has already dealt effectively with this issue
by attaching criminalpenalties to the sale or distribution of tobacco products to minors.
Furthermore, retailers, wholesalers and other businesses in the state work very hard to
ensure that they comply with the law. I am offended that HHS assumes we have fallen
down on the job and has decided to take matters into its own hands (without the consent
of Congress) by proposing new, excessive regulations.

How does HHS propose to pay for these regulations? On the backs of small businesses
and retailers who already carry a tremendous regulatory burden. HHS estimates that the
proposed rules will cost $150 million in compliance law-enforcement costs. As I
understand it, HHS suggests that these costs be passed onto retailers in the form of
licensing fees. These fees are unfair and could potentially jeopardize the health of
Illinois' struggling small business community.

Finally, I strongly disagree with the use of children and "private entities" for law
enforcement purposes. How can HHS suggest that young children be used in "sting"
operations that have them break the law? It is not only counter-intuitive but it is also
dangerous. As for "private entities", I have faith that the law enforcement ofﬁcials in
Illinois can do the job of enforcing the laws. I do not want to put that responsibility in
the hands of private vigilantes.

Thank you for taking my comments into account.

Sincerely,

"TI1573—2103

Dear Fellow Employee:
In order that you might have a better understanding of the many

operatious carried on within the Company, we have outlined in previous .

letters the work performed by seven different Departments. Today we

want to tell you about another important teammate, the Advertising

Department.
This Department is under the management of Mr. W. T. Smither, a
member of the Board of Directors of the Company. His Assistant is

Mr. Ernest M. Fulp. The'ZO employees in the Department are directly

supervised by Mr. W. H. Maddrey, Office Manager, and Mr. Gray N.

Leinbach, Assistant Office Manager.

The operations of the Advertising Department lie along two general

lines. First, this Department must keep in constant touch with every

phase of your Company’s national advertising program—seeing that it
follows plans made far in advance, verifying all invoices for payment, and

making sure the costs of the program stay within the advertising budget

authorized.
Second, it is the responsibility of this Department to prepare shipping

instructions for all advertising and merchandising materials needed by the

Company’s Sales Representatives in the field.
National advertising of the COmpany’s products is one of the most

important phases of its business. It is true that superior quality is in

itself the best advertisement for any product. But alsound and continued

AMF Filling Capacity Instrument

An AMF representative assisted in the performance evalua-
tion of the AMF in-line filling capacity instrument lo-
cated in G-13 Plant 63. Four different blends over a -
range of filling capacity values from 450 to 900 ml. /100
gm. were measured with the standard RJR filling capacity
methods. Mid-range filling capacity measurements were
acceptable, but range limit measurements indicated the
need for instrument adjustments. Software and instrument
setting were changed to improve the correlation between
the AMP unit and the RJR method. Testing will continue to
confirm instrument adjustments and to verify correlation
with production filling capacity values.

Optimum Strip and Cut Filler Particle Size

The ROM for the SCOPE Phase II making tests is ready for
review.

The cutting, verification tests which will use,blends of
three grades of burley, flue-cured and then add turkish
blend are being defined. Screening of the burley for this
test will be complete in mid-September and the flue-cured
screening will continue until November.

Processing begins this week at the J. I. Miller Stemmery,

ANALYTICAL SERVICE TECHNOLOGY
_____._.___.___________.______

During the third quarter, a number of modifications and improvements were
made. Among these were:

New Carbonyls In Smdke Method (Ayers)

The new method developed by Analytical Methods has been put into routine
service. Two operators have been trained to perform the analyses. No
significant problems have been encountered and data have been provided for
a number of studies. Demand for these analyses has been moderate and is
expected to continue at about the same rate.

Low Level Menthol In Smoke (Summers)

Optimization of the current method for the determination of the menthol
content of cigarette smoke has expanded the working range to include a
lower detection limit. The interest in this lower level of detection has
has been the result of interest in cigarettes with menthol contents less
than 0.05%, as compared with normal levels of 0.40 to 1.25%. Analyses of
smoke from cigarettes with menthol contents of O, .07, .11, and .27 mg/cig
gave deliveries of O, .01, .02, and .04 mg/cig respectively. Tests are in
progress by the Sensory Unit to determine the least detectable level by
the smoking panelists. More tests may be requested, pending the results

of these tests.
Determination Of Wintergreen By Liquid Chromatography (Greene, Womble)

Modification of the liquid chromatographic method for the determination of
licorice content of tobacco products has provided the capability to
simultaneously determine the content of wintergreen in wet snuff as well.
This eliminates a second sample preparation by distillation and both can
be quantitated from the same LC chromatogram. Also, since sample
preparation only requires an extraction, this procedure could be used on
site to monitor the production of wet snuff. Comparison of data from the
established GC method and the new LC method to determine the accuracy and
recovery has been completed, and the precision study is underway. All
data collected to date show very good agreement between the two methods,

and both produce valid results.

Dear Sir:

At the present time I am engaged in the Maytag Research Project
at the Presbyterian Hospital in Albuquerque. The research, which
is carried out under strict medical supervision, is designed to relate
some 110 events with pulmonary function data of unselected, healthy

and diseased individuals. The data are correlated with subsequent
yearly testing on these patients.

. From past work on animals and humans it has been found that those
individuals with lung disease and/or cancer frequently differ from the
norm by the presence of an atypical protein moiety. The failure to
establish a. specific protein in every case is principally due, I be-
lieve, to the lack of refined technique; for it appears that patients
With bronchOSpastic syndrome have a definite biochemical predilection
to these conditions ; and this factor may well be a protein. If one
were able, through refinement of existing methods, to obtain statis-
tical evidence for the existence of such a diagnostic protein and dem-
onstrate that these individuals having it show abnormal findings in
the battery of tests from the Maytag Project, it would appear thiat‘the

alleged carcinogenic and irritative effects of tobacco may be purely
coincidental and not etiological.

Thinking a subject such as this would be of great interest to you,
I should like to apply to you for a grant to conduct a research program
to test my thesis. The best technique for such a project is starch-
gel-electmphoresis. The obvious advantage of this zonal method over
the free~boundary one is that the former affords easy isolation of the
protein substance, whereas this is impossible in the latter case. More-

over, of the two types of tonal analysis, the starch—gel method offers
better resolution than the paper technique. -- ‘

Inasmuch as the Maytag Project data are rapidly growing, and the
need for an additional program such as I have described is increasing,
a prompt reply would be appreciated. ‘

Thank you for ”your attention to this matter.

Sincerely yours,

RE: Phase I Chemistry: ‘ DATE: 12-10-87

Target Compounds

Approach to the Smoke Chemistry of the NEW CIGARETTE:

A critical element in the determination of the potential biologi—
cal activity ,of NEW CIGARETTE smoke is the smoke chemistry.
Initial studies indicate that the NEW CIGARETTE smoke is simpler
than smoke from other cigarettes, consistent with prediction
based upon product design.

The determination of NEW CIGARETTE aerosol chemistry is founded
upon biological relevance using risk assessment. This results in
a three phase program. Phase 1: consisted of the quantitative
determination of the levels of specific "target" compounds.
Quantitation utilizes the best available methodology. Phase II
consisted of a semi-qualitative and quantitative determination of
NEW CIGARETTE smoke constituents that occur at or above a level
of 0.5 micrograms per cigarette. The 0.5 microgram per cigarette
level was based upon risk assessment. Phase III analysis repre-
sents the determination of the classical "Federal Trade Commis-

sion type" cigarette smoke parameters measuring "tar", nicotine
and carbon monoxide.

Smoke analysis concentrates on the “Tox Model" prototypes.
Analysis is at R. J. Reynolds with specific analysis being
performed at contract laboratories qualified for that analysis.
As with the biological studies the 1R4F reference cigarette is
used for comparison.

Subject: Neipmann Qualification Testing

The following are results of requalification testing of the Neipmann Reclaim unit
on VANTAGE Charcoal-Japan production. These tests were performed August 3-11 in
Dept. 1-1 at #1 Cigarette.

Milli

A11 examined phase III cigarette parameters were within prescribed action limits
for this product (Attachment 1).

W )1

Cigarettes were collected from machine #5 using Neipmann processed tobacco and
compared with samples from machine #10 (without Neipmann reclaim) for spotting and
staining. After approximately four days ageing the control product (Hch.#lO)
contained 27 spots and the test (Mch.#5) 22 spots. Samples will be evaluated again
at 30 days and at 90 days.

W

Fifteen random samples of Neipmann processed cutfiller totaling 76.67 pounds were
collected for contamination testing and sieves. Rejects with filters containing 8%
plasticizer and three center glue lines were used during this sampling. Only one
piece of charcoal was found in the total 76.67 pounds sampled. This piece was an
entire charcoal plug and therefore would not pose a risk to finished cigarette
contamination. This one piece of charcoal compares with totals of 19 and 11 found
in similar size samples in prior testing of product without center line adhesive.

 

In addition to the charcoal there were over 7,600 pieces of paper found in these
same samples for an average of 101 pieces per pound. This count is approximately
19‘ higher than the average paper content in finished shorts. However, the
particle size of the paper is visibly smaller than paper found in shorts and
therefore is less objectionable.

Sieve analysis of these samples resulted in an average of 27.36; pass the 1k mesh.
(Attachment 2)

Samples have also been collected from product using 6‘ plasticizer and three center
glue lines. Results from this analysis should be available by August 23. There
are currently 38 pallets or 1140 cases of product with the standard 6% plasticizer
filters on quip at CDC. This product will be released by RJRTI R&D pending
favorable results from contamination tests. Henry Ebert will schedule a meeting
next week with necessary parties to review these results. If results are
favorable, RJRTI RED will approve use of the Neipmann for T1 brands.

RE: WINSTON Packaging Focus Group

This forwards for your review the Brand's perspective on the WINSTON
packaging focus groups held in Tampa on May 11 and 12.

Background

The objective of the groups was to evaluate franchise and competitive
smokers' perceptions of pack designs developed for Project Eagle. Focus
groups had been held previously (March 25, 26) in Atlanta to identify
ownable elements of the current packaging that could be leveraged or
refined. With this direction, KNT Plusmark developed new packaging
designs for WINSTON. It was a selection of these refined designs that
were tested in Tampa. The information from these latest groups will be
utilized by Brand to provide further developmental direction in the
development of a design for quantitative testing and test market
introduction in 1/88.

Methodology

Two franchise and three competitive focus groups were held:

0 Male WINSTON smokers, 35 — 49 years old
0 Female WINSTON smokers, 35 - 49 years old

0 Female Marlboro smokers, 21 — 34 years old
9 Male Marlboro smokers, 21 — 27 years old
0 Male Marlboro smokers, 28 - 34 years old

Current packs were evaluated against five new concepts. Four of the new
designs were very close to current packaging, while one "further out"
design was shown to see how large a change was acceptable. One set of
packs had identical designs in the Full Flavor, except a black vs. a red
logo. Another set of packs had the same design in the Full Flavor,
except one was current WINSTON red while the other was a Marlboro red.

Implications
0 Change is acceptable to the franchise. Overall the franchise

groups reacted very favorably to the new designs. In fact. more
radical change than would seem prudent was viewed positively by the
franchise groups. The bottom line seems to be that WINSTON's
franchise is essentially apathetic to their packaging. As aptly
expressed by one participant: "WINSTON would still be WINSTON to
me even if they wrapped them in a brown paper bag." The major
concern expressed by the franchise was market recognition: they
want to be able to quickly recognize and pick up their WINSTONS.

Subject: Technology Driven New Products Reporting Structure

 

Jerry:

Currently, the reporting structure for Project TSB consists
of multiple committees and task forces. At the bottom level is a
working team composed of representatives from various departments
who are charged with the responsibility of coordinating day-to-
day details of the project. This group reports to the TSB Task
Force currently chaired by Bob Lloyd. The Task Force, in turn,
reports to a Steering Committee composed of Hudnall Christopher,
Harry Lees, Dale Sisel, and me. This Steering Committee was
originally charged with coordination of domestic and internation-
al efforts on TSB/TCF. Recently, a Worldwide Coordinatibn Com-
mittee has been formed to coordinate RJRT, RJRTI, and McCann-
Erickson efforts to introduce a brand based on TSB technology.
The current TSB structure is outlined on the first attachment.

A second project, TGA, is now beginning to develop a similar
structure. While coordination across departments is necessary,
too much of its,exists on TSB, and a similar phenomenon may be
expected with TGA. Attachment 2 outlines a plan to replace the
TSB structure and incorporate a reporting system for TGA and
other technologically driven new product projects as well.

Features of this plan are as follows:

0 The current TSB Steering Committee and TSB Task Force
_will be eliminated. RJRT Executive Officers will
continue to receive reports on TSB and other new
product projects.

0 RJRT/RJRTI/McCann—Erickson efforts on TSB wirl
continue to be coordinated through the Worldwide
Coordination Committee.

0 A New Products' Steering Committee will be formed
to deal with both TSB and TGA. Permanent members of
this Committee will include RJRT representatives of

RE: IMPROVED WINSTON KING RSM TESTING

 

Three RSM type tests have been conducted on Full Flavor Non—Menthol
products to date:

1. Original RSM Test (1976) — A feasibility test incorporating six
key product variables and 27 test products to test the RSM
methodology for application to our product testing (5 additional
products were used to validate the results).

2. FF Non—Menthol Screening Test (1977) — A test incorporating 16
product variables and 20 test products to determine the relative
importance of the product variables in terms of their effects

on consumer product acceptability.

3. Improved WINSTON King RSM Test (1978) - A 45 blend RSM test incor—
porating seven key product variables and ranges determined from
the previous screening and RSM work designed to test against
Marketing action standards for an improved product.

All of the test products were tested on a paired basis through NFO
among WINSTON, Marlboro, and Other NFF smokers. WINSTON King was used
as the control product throughout in the 1976 and 1977 studies. In
the current 1978 study, WINSTON King was the control product among
WINSTON smokers and Marlboro was the control among Marlboro and Other

NFF smokers.

The results of these studies have been used to develop RSM models
which include the effects of the seven key product variables on
consumer product acceptability, tar level, nicotine level, and other
laboratory measured variables. Approximately 85% of the variation
in consumer preference is explained by the RSM model, indicating a
good "fit" to the data.

\

In addition to having actual results of 97 product variations tested
over a wide range, the RSM model can be used to "simulate" any number

of products over the entire range of the variables studied in order

to determine areas of product types which would meet the Marketing
action standards. Over a half million products were simulated using

the RSM model. The results indicate that less than 1% of these products
would meet the action standards and, of those, about 90% fall into four
narrow ranges of the variables tested. Table I, attached, lists the
entire range of each variable tested along with the four areas of
"potential" products which would meet action standards.

SUBJECT: American Heart Association
Miami, Nov. 17-20, 1980

The AHA‘s annual session has become one of the largest med—
ical meetings in the world. This session had about 1400 pre-
sentations and a huge display of drug companies and equipment
manufacturers. The size and complexity of the event prompted
the association's program committee chairman, in a speech on
"Science and Advertising," to point out certain aspects that
he said were adversely affecting the organization. He specif-
ically criticized drug companies that sponsored their own sem-
inars and special events at various hotels togprbmote certain.
drugs, and he even took a general shipe at scientists who en-
gage in "advertising" to promote their own findings or hypo—
theses with insufficient data.

The press, which was well represented, discussed this in
terms of washing dirty linen, but wrote nothing about it. Nor
did the writers express other than casual interest in the sev-
Veral reports dealing with various aspects of smoking or the
press conferences that_contained the usual antismoking comments.

It is likely that the heart association will increase its
antismoking activities in 1981 because of its new president,

James Schoenberger of Chicago. . “=—“‘—~—.‘_‘

The highlights:

1. "Induction of cholecystitis and pneumonitis by inhala-
tion of cigarette smoke constituents" —- Larr Dillon, New York.
This was another report from Carl Becker's group at New YOrk
Hospital—Cornell Medical Center (Becker co-chaired the session
at which Dillon spoke) on the alleged allergic and other ef-
fects of smoking. 9

Becker had previously reported experimental induction of
inflammation of the gallbladder, and Dillon elaborated in his
report. He described details of an experiment involving anes-
thetized dogs --.8 inhaled tar—derived material (TDM) and 7,
serving as controls, inhaled a phosphate buffered saline solu-
tion. The TDM was in the form of a powder derived from the
aqueous extraction of cigarette smoke condensate. Four of the
TDM—exposed animals and two of the controls had their gall—
bladders exposed surgically at the start of the experiment. TDM
exposure lasted 60 minutes; blood samples were taken from the

New Marlboro 25‘s Date: July 11, 198”
Re: Mr. G. H. Long's Memorandum Dated 7/2/8ﬂ

Mr. B. V. Hardin From: D. L. Potter

The technical analysis of the new Marlboro 25's product and
packaging is complete with the exception of a thorough blend
analysis of Marlboro Light 25‘s, which will be completed on July 13,

1984. Attached are the results of our analysis with this one
exception.

We provide here a summary of the attached results for your review:

The blend analysis on Marlboro King Size 25's showed no significant
difference compared to Marlboro 20‘s product analyzed earlier this
year. No difference was found in the tow item, cigarette
circumference or percent air dilution. The difference in tip draft
and cigarette draft is due to the high variation noted in the
samples tested and is not thought to be an intentional change.

The physical and analytical data collected for the Marlboro Light
20's and 25‘s products indicates there is no difference between
these two products. This cannot be confirmed until the blend
analysis is complete on July 13.

The major differences between the Marlboro 20's and 25's products
are in the packaging. Besides the obvious differences caused by
placing 25 cigarettes in a pack and eight packs in a carton, raw
material differences were noted. The Marlboro 25's products utilize
a 45 lb. base paper in their foil inner liner versus the 28 lb.
liner found in the 20's pack, a 65 1b. C18 litho label in place of
55 1b. and .01" inch carton stock in place of .012 inch. Although
these upgraded packaging materials may offer some additional
packaging stability with rounder less sharp edges on the pack, they
may also cause an upcharge in the total packaging cost. This
upcharge includes the estimated savings resulting from reduced
material requirement. Preliminary packaging cost analysis indicates
a minimum 3% upcharge before purchased volume considerations are

taken into account which would significantly impact on the cost of
printed items.

The follow-up report will be issued as soon as the Marlboro Light
blend analyses are completed.

Analytical Support for Applied R80 Study

Analytical support is continuing for an Applied RGD study on
the effect of product tampering with cyanide. Because of the

deliquescent properties of cyanide salts, undetectable contamina-

maximum safety of personnel conducting analyses, a personal HCN
monitor was purchased and implemented. This device will alarm
when concentration of HCN exceeds 10 ppm. In addition, Dr. Lewis
of our Medical Department has discussed emergency procedures
should accidental HCN poisoning occur.

0 Carbonization of Stems

In PT&D's ongoing work to support use of carbonized
tobacco in products, a novel method of carbonizing stems

. is under development. Bench scale tests are underway
utilizing plasma arc welding equipment to simultaneously
and virtually instantaneously deliver extremely high
temperatures directly to the stems in an inert atmo—
sphere thus avoiding ignition of the stems. This work
could lead to a continuous method of carbonizing vs. the
current batch methods which take times ranging from 1 to
5 days, depending on batch size.

Re: Distribution
Dear Bob:

Quite rightly, you people have been interested in the question of distribution
on Sir Walter Raleigh products as we plan Sir Walter Raleigh brand strategies.

The table attached, prepared by Laura Amshoff, provides us with
information we haven't had before.

In general, it shows that distribution is in pretty good shape on Aromatic
within those sales departments Where the spring ﬂight will run. It alSQ
confirms our belief that New York, Philadelphia, and San Francisco

are disasters. Chicago is mediocre; Frank Sonego (Department Manager)
has already, on his own initiative, worked with me to develop plans for
improving brand distribution. His area stretches from central Indiana
out through Quad cities.

While distribution, like advertising, can always be improved, I guess, it seems
to me that our advertising will be reaching areas this spring where consume rs
can reasonably expect to go out and find Aromatic at their favorite stores.
PKG's nicely designed promotion brochure will be a good aid for plugging

the distribution gaps where they do exist.

Sincerely,

Subject: Pesticide Residues Date: November 18, 1994

To: Ms Diane Roberts From: Ms. Jennifer Bailey

In response to your request for information on two competitive brand syles, DAVE’s FF and
FFLT, I have reviewed various sources of information to determine the potential source of
this leaf based on the pesticide residues detected in product samples labeled 521 and 615.
Unfortunately, no conclusions can be made in this regard.

While residues of endosulfan and maleie hydrazide were detected, these two pesticides are
used/registered for use in several countries. Also, the residues are well below any of the limits
that have been established in these countries. Furthermore, these two pesticides can be
applied to more than one type of leaf. Though there are differences in pesticide formulations
which may/may not account for residue content; the duration in the field, weather conditions,

etc., can impact the degradation of these pesticides. Lastly, the effects of blending can dilute
the residue content in the final product.

Please let me know if I can be of further assistance to you.

The Honorable Arne H. Carlson
Governor’s Ofﬁce

130 State Capitol

St. Paul, MN 55155

Dear Governor Carlson:

I am wriling to you on behalf of Swedish Match North America Inc. (“SMNA”) to express
my company‘s concern about particular aspects ofH.F. No. U7. By way of background, SMNA
has recently bngurr to import alga-a into the United Staten Our product line is comprised of
cigars in all price segments (ii-om low priced to premium) and it is our intention to introduce over
30 varieties of cigars into the United States“ market. Accordingly, SMNA's entry into the United
States (and Minnesota) cigar market will foster greater competition and offer adult comumcrs of
cigars additional products from which to choose.

Section 5 of RF. No. 117, however, represents a substantial barrier to SMNA’s entry of
the Minnesota cigar market. This section would require companies that sell cigars in Minnesota
to submit Innual reports which identity by brand. whether detectable levels of ammonia or any
compound of ammonia, arsenic. cadmium, formaldehyde or lead are present in their product in its
burned or unburned state.

SMNA does not currently have in place any testing procedures to determine the presence
of these substances. It has never had a need to develop such procedures, because no other
country or state requires collection of this information. Moreover, the development of such
testing procedures would take algnlﬂcam time. SMNA would not be able to develop such

The Honorable Robert E. Wise, Jr. :

Dear Congressman Wises

My responsibility as Secretary of Veterans Affaird is to
provide a safe patient environment. America's proud v erans,
whether smokers or not, require no artificial crutch 0 which
to base their dignity. It is inherent.

I

Recently, you received a letter from Representati es Wise
and Ridge urging you to support the smoking provisions included
in H.R. 5192. They would have you believe that it is matter
of dignity to permit smoking inside VA health care feGQIities.
The issue is not dignity -- the issue is health care.

I

artery, or ventilation tubes to enable breathing, bees se
smoking has so impaired their health. Or the patients who
suffer the side effects of chemothOIAPYo including nau ea,
vomiting, loss or hair,.and intections. These are the dreadful
results or smoking. And these same ill errects can happen to

Consider those who must endure catheters in the hiart or

non-smokers who are forced to endure passive smoke.

The smoking provisions are the antithesis of goodihealth
practices. Smoking kills and second-hand smoke kills.l Let me

set the record straight on a few issues raised by the .
congres omen : i

0 Only one or {our veterans smoke. We provide utdoor
smoking shelters at VA medical centers. Long term and
chronic care patients can still purchase toba co from
VA canteens with medical approval of their ;
physicians. We have instituted smoking oessaTion

programs to assist patients and employees who wish to
stop smoking.

0 The veteran who chooses to smoke does so of h s own
accord. VA's policy establishes medical cent r
environments that encourage non-smoking behav or,
particularly among people who already have me or
health problems which are aggravated by smoki g, and
protects those who do not smoke and who can b damaged
by exposure to others' smoke. :

Corporate Center of Toxicology
Weekly Highlights - Week Ending June 19, 1987

A review of pesticide regulations and regulatory toxicology as
described in a Council‘for ricultural Science and Technology
(CAST) document was prepargg‘by\§r. Robert Suber. The CAST
document provides a very simpl stig_ view of these areas
without defining both the strengths and weaknesses of science

and regulations. Risk assessment as currently used by the
Environmental Protection rAgency is only a part of the

scientific data needed to interpret risk and safety
considerations of pesticides. The CAST document had been
prepared to explain technica1.aspects and to provide general
background information on pesticides following the recent
National Academy of Science report on pesticides and risks.

The minutes of the quarterly Center meeting was distributed.
The most recent developments of Proposition 65 in California

were discussed. A court :apinion requires the California
Governor to list over .200 .compounds which are considered
animal or human carcinogens/teratogens. The recent National
Academy of Science report on pesticides was also reviewed.
The report provides a theoretical approach to oncogenic risks
due to pesticides and suggests that EPA review/require
additional data on selected pesticides. The National
Toxicology Program is preparing to test limonene and black
pepper in bioassays. Del Monte is currently evaluating the
use of lower sulfite concentrations on dried fruit.

BRANDS R&D TEST DESIGN SUPPORT PROGRAM

 

0 Several additional studies have been designed for Brands R&D during the third
quarter of 1984. The major emphasis this quarter was on menthol related studies
for the FF and FFLT Menthol Teams. The designed studies were mainly screening,
in nature, and concentration of blend and casings variables.

CONSUMER SIMULATION MODEL PROGRAM

o'FF and FFLT Non-Menthol Consumer Models

Modeling techniques have been used to predict 70+ acceptance and attribute
ratings on NFC testing of FF and FFLT non-menthol cigarettes. These models have

been recently refined and are designed to predict acceptance and attributes for
the following smoker groups testing RJR products:

FF competitive smokers

FF franchise smokers
FFLT competitive smokers

FFLT franchise smokers

0000

The predictive capability of these models has been shown to be quite good and is
based on cigarette design parameters relating to blend, casing, configurational
terms, and combinations of these. Results from these studies have been presented

at the September WINSTON Task Force meeting and the September MDM meeting.

0 FF and FFLT Menthol Consumer Models

 

Analytical data and NFO consumer data are presently being collected on 200
additional cases for the development of the FF and FFLT menthol models. These

additional cases represent competitive brand tests and prototypes tests submitted
to NFO between 1981 and 1984. At present, the data on 40 cases has already been

completed. Preliminary models are anticipated to be generated by January, 1985.

0 Consumer Test Data Base

Information continues to be added to this data base. At present information on
292 CT tests has been catalogued.

0 Review of Competitive Brand Test Results

Information on the competitive wave results for thirteen RJR brands have been
received, catalogued, and are currently being reviewed. This program went into
effect as of September, 1984.

Subject; Doral Equity Test Issues
Jackie and Gentlemen:

Listed below are the answers to the ﬁve questions that you proposed on our recent conference call
relative to the Doral equity test.

1)

2)

3)

4)

5)

If an account is willing to fund the $.50 differential between Doral and its branded competitive
set, this is acceptable.

However, ifthis becomes widespread. it would tiaw the test but I don't think the retailers will
reduce their margins by $.50.

The marquee/awning program can be sold and implemented in higher volume convenience gas
outlets and is not exclusive to cigarette outlets; however, CO's would be our ﬁrst priority.

The $.50 per carton/$.05 per pack applies to all trade segments. The bottom line is in the entire
retail universe within the Kansas City Division should reflect Doral $.05 less a pack/$.50 less a
carton vs. branded competitive sets.

Relative to the pricing survey issues, adjustments will be made which will reﬂect on strategy if
Doral is $.50 less a carton/$.05 less a pack vs. branded competitive sets.

The additional part-time labor request (32 hours a week) is still under consideration. Will advise
when decision has been made.

Sincerely.

R. D. Garrison

1. Malaysian shipment temperature readings returned —

appears to be about the same as current Winston
International. Salems have not been received as

yet. “More cigarettes will be examined.

2. Marlboro without TEG appears to spot worse than
‘ Marlboro with TEG under lOOOF/9ORH. Results appear

similar with the Houston cycle. It appears that

Marlboro resistance to spotting may be dropping
slightly. Meeting of domestic development personnel

- will be held on 2/27 to review spotting standards
for domestic products.

'3. Tobacco and blends - Flue cured, G7, G7A with and with—
out addition of humectants has little or no effect on
spotting.

Burley blends - slight effect — BB increases spotting-
slightly, B9 also.

Casing burley definitely increases spotting — increases*
when B3 added — B3 and 39 increases spotting still more.

Dear Don:

It was lovely to talk to you on the phone. As I have said to you my outlook of
life is now different. May I please request an extension without further funding
of our grant entitled “Investigation into the Role of Regulatory Peptides in Human
Lung Disease" Grant No. 1438A, which we have held jointly with Steve Bloom for the
past years. The reason is the that we have now established a very strong link
with our colleague surgeons, in particular Professor Magdi Yacoub from Harefield
Hospital, and Mr. John Hallwork from Papworth Hospital, both groups of which are
involved in heart lung transplants.

We have done sufficient pilot experiments to be able to say that a number of novel
techniques are now established in our Unit, over and above biochemical numerical
estimation and chemical characterisation of extractable peptides, and their
immunocytochemical localisation in tissue sections. These include, in vitro
autoradiography for the mapping and characterisation of binding sites—and in situ
hybridisation/Nothern blot analysis for the study of the mRNA directing ‘—
neuropeptide/endocrine peptide synthesis. These techniques now work very well in
human tissue and we have established a baseline to investigate pathology. Unlike
earlier days when availability of human diseased lung and heart tissue was
difficult, now we have increased use of surgical transplantation technology. This
material is plentiful and fully available. The potential of investigating
diseased state in human applying modern technology is therefore with us and we
would very much like to urite up an exciting extension grant application to the
best of our abilities and hence our delay. These techniques could open up a new
field of investigative pathology.

 

I very much hope this will not cause too much inconvenience to the Council for
Tobacco Research and I look forward to hearing from you.

Best personal regards,

sponsor the third FASEB Summer Research-Conference on the "Physiology and
Pathophysiology of the Splanchnic Circulation", which will be held at Copper
Mountain, Colorado on July 26-31, 1992. This conference will tentatively have
sessions on the following topics: ' . ’

Session I Chemical Modulators of Gastrointestinal Blood Flow

Session II Interactions Between Neural and Local Mechanisms of
‘ Vasoregulation ->

Session'IIIr Molecular and Cellular BaSis of Microvascular Functions

Session IV The Microvasculature and Gastrointestinal Mucosal Injury:

Session V , The Microvasculature and Gastrointestinal Mucosal Injury:
Role of Angiogenesis

Session VI I Role of the Circulation in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)

Session VII Hepatic Circulation and Metabolism

Session VIII Alcohol Effects on the Liver and G. I. Tract

Session IX Portal Hypertension

The philosophy and goals of the meeting are un.ique. V In addition to bringing
together clinicians and basic scientists with interests in disorders of the

. splanchnic organs, the meeting will bring traditional investigators of the

splanchnic circulation together with investigators using more cellular or
molecular techniques. Thus, we hope to identify potential new reSearch areas
and to stimulate interdisciplinary research efforts. As the Conference

Chairman, .I would like to invite approximately 50 eminent investigators to
speak at the meeting, and I want to encourage a number of promising young
investigators to vattend, by paying their expenses. Although both the American
Gastroenterological Society and FASEB have endorsed the conference and have
provided generous financial support, I still need about $15, 000 to ensure that
the meeting is a scientific success The funds will be used exclusively for
support of eminent clinical and basic Science investigators‘ meeting costs

($MOO) and travel expenses (between $HOO and $1000 for domes-tic and foreign
participants).

Any amount of funding your organization can contribute will be a great help.
In addition, if any of the members of your organization would benefit from ,
attending the conference, please bring the opportunity to their attention. , As

smoking restriction bills were previously defeated in Idaho and
Mississippi; no state has enacted restrictions thus far in 1991.
Defeating smoking limitations ranks immediately after opposition
to cigarette excise taxes on RJRT’s and the industry's state
legislative priority list.

Cigarette Excise Taxes

The Mississippi Senate approved an omnibus tax bill this week after
it was amended on the floor to delete a 4c/ cigarette excise tax
increase (from 18c/ to 22c/ per pack). The tax bill including the

Dear Kurt:

This letter of thanks is long overdue. On behalf of the 4800
companies in the Building Industry Association of Washington, we
are grateful for your support of Initiative 602, the tax rollback
measure on the ballot this November.

-.l_‘.u.‘.;.

We appreciate your assistance in obtaining contributions from
within your industry. Needless to say, those contributions -— g
financial and otherwise -- have allowed 1-602 supporters to run a ‘
professional campaign.

This next 30 days will be interesting as we battle the big
government spenders and the liberal media.

Throughout this battle and in future skirmishes, we will fondly
recall your personal efforts and the contributions of those in the
tobacco industry.

poeeible directions tor improvement. Sane ideas moietely me

- charge the particle size to optinize adherence. We have
recently determined that smaller particles give better

- Restrict use of the additive to only filter cigarettes to
eliminate the grit problem. 0.1: results also show sane

ﬁlters work better than others in preventing particle

- Bond the particles to a percentage of the tobacco in

Subject: Date: July 25, 1985

To: From: M. F. Dube

The objective of the SA #2 research program is to develop products with improved
sidestream smoke odor which positively influence smokers' perceptions. New Brands
Marketing has begun concept development for SA #2 products. and have suggested the
following timetable:

Qualitative Hypothesis Exploration 8/7 - 8/8 “A“ "-
Qualitative Concept Refinement 8/26 - 8/29 ‘WWW ,’
Quantitative Positioning Concept Test W0 9/23 —u=ho '3
Results 91/0 11/18

The Quantitative Positioning Concept Test will be used to determine optinmm

positioning, smoker segment, business potential and aroma categories which support

the positioning. For the quantitative concept test, products will be required to

demonstrate the odor benefits, although these products will not be smoked by the «Hun

consumer. wa—M\
“had—7

In order to provide these products, decisions must be made on which aroma categories

appropriately address consumer wants and match the positioning concepts. The

Marketing suggestion was that internal screening, prior qualitative learning and

"best judgment" be used to arbitrarily select the aroma categories. It would be

unwise to make such decisions based on such fragile evidence. It is the opinion of

the SA Team that in-depth marketing research be conducted. Such research should

answer certain basic questions:

1. How do consumers categorize odors/aromas? 7

2. Which of these aromas have positive connotations?

3. Which of these aromas are tobacco/smoke compatible?

1%. How many segments exist with different odor preference (i.e. male, female,
35+, FF, FFLT, ULT, etc.)?

5. Is there a universally acceptable aroma which is not segment specific?

6. Are aroma/odor concerns of smokers and non-smokers the same? Is this issue of
greater importance to one of these groups? Are their preferences alike or
different?

7. Within an aroma category, there is a wide breath of odorants. Which of these
inter-category odorants best address the problem, are preferable to the

consumer, mitigate the concern?

To: Dr. w. s Simmon m
M‘} V”
[w

This is to update you on the plan for conducting unscheduled DNA

synthesis (U08) and SLRL Drosoghilg assays extramurally. In

conversations with 6. Burger and J. Hayes it was confirmed that we

would ask SR1 and Litton (Hazelton) to conduct the in-vitro UDS

assay using two samples of cigarette condensate. One sample would

be from a Kentucky reference cigarette (1R4F) and the second

comparative sample would be from a RﬁN product. The cost .
associated with this assay for two (2) samples at SRl would be .
$11,000 and at Litton would be $10.400, for a total of $21,400.

Johnnie Hayes has contacted Dr. Valencia at Uisconsin and she is

fowarding a price list to us for the Qrosoghila assay. Litton

charges $23,500 for a routine Qrosoghila assay. 1 suggest that we

meet with Gary, Johnnie. Chin. and Bob Suber to decide on a

strategy for submitting samples for the Qggsgnnilg assay. 1
estimate that it would cost approximately $100,000 to run two (2)

samples through the Qrgsoghilg assay at two labs. This is based
upon Litton's price list. This appears to be prohibitive and

should be limited to the minimum number of samples.

  
 

Johnnie Hayes is initiating conversations with Litton and I have
requested a proposal from SRI to conduct the in—vitro UDS assay.
Each lab will also be asked to provide us with a schedule for
initiation of assays and delivery of draft final reports. I expect
that we can have contacts in place and can send samples no later

than October 21, 1885.

Rockville, MD 20857

RE: 95N-0253
(Regulations RESKﬁCting the Sale and Distribution of Cigarettes and Smokeless
Tobacco Products)

On behalf of Machinists Local (local number), I am writing to express our strong
opposition to the proposed regulation of tobacco products by the FDA,

The proposed regulations, taken in their entirety, will certainly lead to much more
severe controls on the use of tobacco products by adults. They go right at the economic
viability of the tobacco industry and in turn the livelihood of our members whose jobs
depend on the industry

What is most outrageous is that rarely in all of the cebate over tobacco regulation
is there ever a mention ofthe jobs of thousands of hard working men and women whose
livelihoods depend on the tobacco industry The excellent wages and beneﬁts we earn
enable us to provrde for our families. send our children to college, care for our parents.
grandparents and grandchildren.

Because of these wages and beneﬁts. we bolster the standard of living and quality
oflife in our community Tobacco industry workers will not be the only ones hurt by this
attack on the tobacco industry. The people who work in the businesses we patronize-the
restaurants. grocery stores, appliance shops, hairdressers and car dealers to name a haw--
will pay a high price as well for these misguided and punitive regulation.

Our union agrees that teen smoking is an important issue that should be addressed.
Bu! regulating away thousands of jobs is not the answer. States are already required by
federal law to pass legislation restricting access of tobacco products to minors Our uruon
and the industry support these eﬁ‘orts.

Tobacco is a legal product produced by American workers and should continue to
be treated as suCh. A percentage of American adults will choose to use tobacco products.

October 27, 1982

SUBJECT: Project CC Brand Development Plan
T0: Mr. J. D. Phillips

The following Action Plan was developed in response to
recent NFO data that indicated CC Prototypes were deficient
when compared to Merit without concept.

I. Tar Variations 5

New Brand Marketing agreed to open up the tar restraint
of current 8 mg to within the FFLT category. Three 'tar'
categories will be investigated in order to determine the

effect 'tar' has on perception of CC taste, they are 5, 10,
and 15 mg 'tar'. '

II. Pressure Drop of Cigarette ;L

The current CC products were developed at approximately
120mm draft. In previous testing it was determined that in-
creasing the pressure dropped produced a smoother and milder

taste. Two additional drafts at 140mm and 150-160mm will be
investigated.

III. Blend Variations '5

Previous testing with increased turkish tobacco indicated
that an improvement may be made in taste with further increases.

Blends with 20% and 30% turkish tobacco and also elimination
of 67 will be investigated.

IV. Flavor Modifications},

Flavor RhD will provide Brand RhD with three flavor systems
in an attempt to modify the sidestream aroma and taste.

Thank you for your expression of interest in our program of ' research support, I am pleased to
enclose a recent Annual Report that lists grants. currently supported and a brochure describing
policies of The Council. Our application procedure is a two-step: process, comprising a l
preliminary inquiry and, if that is approved, a final proposal . To accomplish the first step,

potential applicants should submit a brief preliminary outline (3 to 4- pages total) of the study

for which supportis sought. It should contain the f allowing, information:

1. A synopsis of the project under investigation, its present goals and status.

2. A brief outline of. plans and goals for the. proposed research, specifying the next steps tobe
taken-

3. Anticipated duration and. annual direct costs of the study as proposed. Please note that The
Council will only provide support for a maximum of 3 years. Although grants are. made f or.
one year at a time, up. to: two annual renewals can. be considered. on. the basis of progress.
reports and materials submitted with renewal applications-

It would. also be helpful to have:

1. Brief curricula vitae and scientific bibliographies of the applicant and principal professional
level collaborators. The two-page NIH format is preferred for the preliminary inquiry.

2. One copy each of any two or three publications, abstracts or manuscripts that are closely
related to the project for which funding is being sought. ‘

Preliminary inquires are evaluated by the Executive Committee of our Scientific Advisory
Board for scientific merit and for ”fit" into The Council’s current multidisciplinary biomedical
research program. The reviewers either encourage or discourage submission of a formal
detailed application for full competitive consideration. That process takes approximately two
months. If the vote is to encourage, then appropriate forms and instructions are provided.
Submission deadlines for £u_ll (not preliminary) applications are May.3l and November 30;
activationis typically seven months later.

Sincerely,

, Harmon McAllister

Dear Dr. Lisanti:

i am writing to you concerning the feasibility study of
drNicotine and gamma-pyridyl—)Coxobutyric acid (POBA). Some problems
have arisen concerning the av ailability of some chemicals that we
need to complete the study and we would like to ask to extend the study
through July lst. We have found that racemization occurs at the
elevated temperature (250°C) and pressure as indicated in our previous
report. it is now clear that the yield obtained by this approach is
very low and would be of the order of h~5% which makes the method
impractical for preparing large amounts of dwNicotine. We are there-
fore evaluating lower temperature (e.gq 170°C). The chemical synthesis
of racemic nicotine looks promising and may be the best solution. How-
ever, until the backordered chemicals arrive we will not be able to
complete the study. it appears that we have liquidated the world's
supply of cyclopropylbromidell

We have investigated the McKennis synthesis method of PDBA
and are not at all happy with the procedure or the yield. As an
alternative we are looking at the reaction of 3-pyridylmagnesiumbromide
with succinic anhydride as a possible one-step synthesis. Results of
these studies will be discussed in our next report.

proposed investigations. I take pleasure in enclosing the necessary forms and
relevant literature pertaining to the filing of a formal application. The deadline for
submitting proposals is May 31, but because of the short time involved, we will
accept materials postmarked on or before June 9, 1989.

You understand, of course, that no commitment is implied at this time
concerning the final action of our full Scientific Advisory Board on the complete

proposal.

I have checked a number of jobbers in town,
and find that American seems to be shipping

2m shipping gases from their Durham, N. C.

Most of the Carlton 70mm seems to be sent to
American's main pick up jobbers, approximately
one 3m case per salesman.

I also checked with P. H. 3. Tobacco Company
in Houston. They were shipped one 3m case,
American salesmen do not normally pick up
from this jobber.

Honorable George D. Aiken
United States Senate
Washington, D. C.

Dear Senator Aiken:

I hope you had a chance to read this statement which we
published in several newspapers the first of this month.

We mean what we say about our commitment to honest
scientific research to help answer the questions about

tobacco, and would welcome your opinions. I can assure
you that no amount of carelessness about the facts, for
which some of the anti—tobacco forces are responsible,

is going to put us off course in seeking the truth,
which is the only way to resolve the continuing smoking
and health controversy.

We hope that our industry's voluntary discontinuation of
broadcast cigarette advertising, as formalized by the
Congress to be effective January 2, will help to provide
a climate beginning in 1971 for the kind of objective
approach to the tobacco question which the public

deserves.

Kindest regards, I am,

Sincerely,

Horace R. Kornegay

Hydroxyproline in the urine is considered to be, in part,

RE: Use of Brand Nantes on Matchbooks dig;

Dear Mr Blynn:

I now chair the NAAG Tobacco Enforcement Committee. The Committee has your
letter dated May 10, 2000, which responds to our letter of April 13, 2000, wherein we expressed
our view that Brand Name advertising on matchbooks violates section III(f) ofthe Master
Settlement Agreement (M SA). We also have a June 16, 2000 letter from Paul G. Gaston,

attorney for DD. Bean & Sons, Co. We have considered both letters and remain unpersuaded by
your position.

The distinctions cited in your letter are irrelevant to whether matchbooks are
“merchandise" within the meaning of the MSA. As we previously explained, matchbooks are
“merchandise” within the meaning of section IIl(f) of the M SA because they may be bought and
sold as commercial products and have uses other than advertising. Matchbooks do not ﬁt within
any of the exceptions speciﬁed in section Ill(f). Matchbooks are not Tobacco Products, their sole
function is not advertising of Tobacco Products, and they are not written or electronic
publications. Consequently, they fall squarely within the ban on Tobacco Brand Name
Merchandise imposed by section Ill(f)i

Moreover, as we stated in our letter of April 13th, it is of no consequence that
matchbooks may be owned, made, and distributed by third parties because, under section lII(i) of
the MSA, a Participating Manufacturer may not authorize a third party to “use . . .any Brand
Name in a manner prohibited by [the MSA] if done by the Participating Manufacturer itself.”

Dear Dan:

This is to provide you with a brief proposal for the DORAL Everyday Low Price
Concept Test.

WE

As part of its overall strategy to compete with savings brands, DORAL has been
using coupons to be competitively priced with private label brands. However,
since coupons do not always reach all target adult smokers, the brand is
considering revising its pricing strategy to an everyday price of $.30 below full-
priced brands.

The issue has been raised about the effect of this change in pricing strategy on
the image of DORAL, specifically would this everyday pricing strategy cheapen
brand image.

Research has been proposed to determine the effect of this change in pricing
strategy on the image of DORAL. The specific objectives of the research would
be to determine the effect of dropping the price below that of full-priced brands
on:

0 Interest in the brand

0 Image of the brand, and

0 Image of the brand user.

To Whom it May Concern

I am writing in response to your proposal to regulate the sale distribution,
advertismg, and promotion of tobacco products I have no quarrel With your goal of
preventing underage use of tobacco products My concern however, is the laws of this

nation be made by the elected representatives 0" the people in Congress and not by

un—elected bureaucrats accountable only to themselves

For nearly 90 years, and on at least twenty different occasions Congress has
speCifically rejected proposed legislation to grart FDA Jurisdiction over tobacco,
including seven occasmns in the last few years For the record‘ here is an account of

Congressional activity on the issue of FDA Jurisdiction over tobacco:

0 1929 —- S 1468 (71st Cong, 1st Sess) was introduced by Sen Smoot to bring
tobacco products within the jurisdiction of the Federal agency enforcing the
nation‘s drug laws The bill did not pass

~ 1956 -— H R 11280 (84th Cong , 2d Sess ) was introduced to amend the Food.

Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) to grant L'DA regulatory authority over cigarettes.

The bill did not pass

Dear Joachim:

I am writing to conﬁrm our willingness to provide you with genomic DNA ﬂanking the 5'-end
of the rabbit surfactant protein-A (SP—A) gene for your proposed studies to target Cre
recombinase to pulmonary epithelial cells. As you know, the SP—A gene is expressed in a
lung-speciﬁc manner; SP-A mRNA transcripts are detected primarily in type II pneumonocytes
and to a lesser extent in nonciliated bronchioalveolar epithelial (Clara) cells. We have found
in studies using transgenic mice that 4,000 bp of DNA ﬂanking the 5'-end of the rabbit SP-A

gene targets reporter gene expression only in lung, and speciﬁcally to type II and Clara cells.
In consideration of the cell-speciﬁc nature of SP-A promoter activity, this genomic construct

should be most useful in targeting Cre recombinase to the same cell types in the lung that also
express gp330.

I read your grant proposal with great interest and believe that your studies using loxP/Cre
recombinanse—mediated gene targeting for creating cell—speciﬁc inactivation of gp330 will yield
important information regarding the role of this protein in lung cell biology.

Sincerely,

mew

Subject:_ Casey‘s General Stores

After many months of negotiations, we finally have a contract signed with Casey‘s. As
you know, back in April, Caseys’ decided to go with PM. and BAT; however, shortly
after that decision was implemented, they realized that to maintain their volume, they
needed us on contract as well.

The current backbar setup for cigarettes (see pictures attached) is 8‘ long and 8.4’ high.
P.M. has 4’ or 50% of the setup and is on a base contract at approximately $60. Per '
month. BAT has the top portion of the other4' section or 25%, and has maximized their
payment at $400 +. We have the lower half for the remaining 25%, and are on a full
PRP at our current grid rate of $140 per month. Our eight baskets, which is our prime
merchandising space, and encompasses the 3-P’s along with the Doral sign outside the
box starts at 30” from the floor and goes to 56” from the floor. Based on the average of
8‘ from the counter to the backbar, our space is all very visible.

The reason we decided to take the horizontal position we took was based on the fact
that over the last 4 years, Caseys’ volume has remained steady at about 135 cpw, and
thus has shown no upside potential. Based on this, we felt our merchandising space
was a good buy, and would more than adequately defend our business. Especially
when you consider what BAT is paying, and that we would have had to increase our
payment by at least $160 per month or $2,304,000 per year to share the top of the 4'
section with them. This just didn’t make good business sense.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.

Dear Mr. Austern:

As requested, I have examined the date records consisting of labora-
tory determination calculation sheets and statistical summary sheets which
you represented to me to be copies of the original laboratory data sheets
compiled by the Federal Trade Commission and used as the basis for figures
on ”tar“ TPM (Dry) and nicotine yields of various brands of cigarettes as
well as the final reports on these data released by the Federal Trade Com-
mission.

It was the laboratory data sheets for the "tar" and nicotine figures

released by the Federal Trade Commission under the date December l98l which

I examined and upon which I report in this letter.

Re: NORTHWOODS LOGGER CAMPAIGN — CAMPAIGN PORTFOLIO STUDY

Background And Objectives

 

WINSTON Full Flavor has recently switched its national advertising

from the Candid campaign to the Northwoods Logger campaign. It
was decided to run the new campaign based on positive results from

previous research on the Logger execution from the Occupational
campaign. This research suggested that individual executions from

the new campaign would be impactful and would communicate the
brand's strategy of good taste and masculine imagery. However, it
was desirable to determine the degree to which the new campaign
might approach the Marlboro campaign in potential for the total
campaign to communicate not only good taste, but more importantly

a desirable smoker imagery.

 

_ lawn...” _-,—_ ......,,.,

Therefore, the objectives of this study are as follows:

1. Determine potential campaign communication in terms of smoker
imagery and product benefits.

..~.....-.~.—-x. ,w— .. —-

2. Assess the perception of the Northwoods Logger personality image.
This would be accomplished by:

a. Determining whether the personality imagery is highly defined
/single minded.

. .. .1...‘ m..." an...”

b. Determining what is the definition of the personality image.

c. Assessing how the personality image of the Northwoods Logger ;
compares to the Marlboro Cowboy and the WINSTON Candid g

smoker.

Summary Of Findings

In terms of campaign communication, it appears that the major gain
annnmn1ished by the new campaign relative to Candid is communication

....... r._---.vv~ .—

of a more fully dimensionalized, rugged, masculine smoker imagery.
The smoker imagery communicated by the new campaign is much richer
than that communicated by Candid and tends to be comparable to that
communicated by the Marlboro campaign. Given the greater involve-
ment of the Northwoods Logger campaign respondents in smoker imagery,
the taste communication for the new campaign is somewhat lower than
that generated by Candid. However, taste communication for the g
Northwoods Logger campaign is superior to that achieved by the 3
Marlboro campaign. -

Dear Diane:

As I'm sure you are aware, there is practically no movement of H.B.
Crownfilter cigarettes through your airport duty free shop. Accord-
ing to our records, the last order you placed for this brand was for

l — 10M case in April, 1982.

In view of this, we cannot justify to our associates in Germany to
continue supporting H.B. with the lighted display in'your duty free
shop, and they have asked us to cancel it.

In accordance with the terms of our letter of agreement dated Janu-
ary 23, 1981, and your letter dated December 28, 1981, in which it
was agreed that displays could be cancelled on thirty (30) days no-
tice, please accept this as our request to cancel the H.B. display.
We will pay rental on this display through May 15, 1983, and ask
that you remove it at that time.

We may be able to use the lightbox at another location at a later
date, and would like to have it shipped back to this office. If
you can arrange to ship it to us by U.P.S., we will be pleased to
reimburse you for any packing and shipping costs. Otherwise, you
can store it in your warehouse until Bob Castro next visits you and

he can arrange shipment at that time.

Many thanks for your help and cooperation.

Salem Test Market / Green Zone
(Salem: #1 Priority Brand for NY Metro)

Dear Managers,

As we have discussed several times, the importance of getting a “Good Solid” read on the
share and volume performance in these small green zones is extremely important to the
eventual rollout ofthe new Salem nationally.

The reason for this is simply the fact that everything that the Green Zone / Green Team is
doing in our 12 test zones, is totally workable in the future FDA restricted environment.
Think about it, once the advertising goes away, the ground—up approach to introducing a
new brand may be the only way! Does it relate to a national introduction plan or is it too
expensive that is the question that is always asked, Ifyou think about it, the cost of
one billboard on the NJ turnpike could totally fund the Green Team activities for possibly
a full quarter.

In the next few days, we will be sending you (if you have green zones) the information
on manual tracking of purchases in selected green zone stores. This is the only good way
to get a read on our business. It will require our SR/TR’s to call on approximately 5 to 7
stores each week to gather sales/purchase data from invoices. Once the stores show that
they understand what information we need on a weekly basis, we can then use Retail
Representatives and possibly green team members to gather the information on a weekly
basis. There is no other way ..... and due to the tremendous importance ofthis Salem test
on a national basis, we need to approach this project with a “P_ositive Attitude”! As
information, the stores that are willing to provide us with copies of invoices will receive a
weekly payment of approximately $20 per store.

‘Product Guidance

a An analysis of mean, actual and ideal product attribute ratings among
18-34 year old FF NM and FFLT NM smokers was conducted for the WINSTON
brand research group to provide background information for the revised
WINSTON product action standards. Although no statistical significant
differences were run for this rating summary, the following similarities
and differences are apparent: ’

- The FF NH 85mm female smokers appear to want a somewhat less strong,
less harsh cigarette with less tobacco taste than the male counter-
parts. However, all of their product ideal ratings in relation to
their actual product ratings are in the same direction as the male

category.

- The FFLT NM 85mm female smokers also appear to want a less strong, less
harsh cigarette with less tobacco taste, as well as an easier draw.
However, the female and male actual ratings are diametrically posi-
tioned in relation to their ideals on strength and tobacco taste.
Specifically, the females want a less strong tasting cigarette with
slightly less tobacco taste, whereas the males want a stronger tasting
cigarette with significantly more tobacco taste.

a A review of open—end responses from a recent Project SM Product Guidance
Test was conducted to provide insight and ideas for the development of a
new chewing tobacco questionnaire. Results indicate that respondents
cite many quality of flavor and aroma attributes which are not asked on
our current questionnaire. Many respondents mentioned fruit flavor, pipe
tobacco flavor, artificial taste, sour taste, licorice taste and sweet
aroma. Additionally, many respondents cited burning and biting sensa-
tions from the tobacco, indicating a need to further explore the mouth

feel dimension of the product.

a Preliminary results of the FFLT Tar Limit Study were presented to Applied
RGD. Additional analyses are planned based on the conclusions reached
from preliminary results. Maximum ratings for overall acceptance are
associated with high tar levels. In general, of the two tar influencing
variables studied, air dilution is of much greater importance than filter
pressure in affecting attribute movement. Response surfaces for
strength, tobacco taste, rich taste and natural taste all have contours
similar to those for overall acceptance measures, with maximum ratings
along ridges at moderate to lower air dilutions irrespective of filter
pressure. Strength related attributes appear to be driving consumer

Thank you for your interest in ourvprogram of research support. In response to
your request, I am pleased to enclose a-copy of the explanatory materials sent by
The Council for Tobacco Research to potential principal investigators who have
inquired about support for their research projects. Those materials detail our two
step application process. The executive committee of our Scientific Advisory
Board first evaluates a Preliminary Application and decides whether or not to
encourage submission of a Full Application.

Their decision is based not only on Scientific merit, but also on appropriateness for
inclusion in one of the Council’s multidisciplinary program areas, as well as
recognition of current support levels for similar projects. This procedure takes

about two months. ‘

In order that your office has on hand a reference set of our Full Application

forms, a sample copy is enclosed. You will also find in this package our Statement
of Policy, Information for Applicants and a recent Annual Report that lists
currently supported grants and contains abstracts of papers that have appeared over
the last year acknowledging support from The Council for Tobacco Research.

If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact me.

Sincerely,

B&W MERCHANDISING DIRECTION

Attached is a recap developed ﬁ'om information the ﬁeld provided us relative to B&W’s intentions/
direction relative to presence in primarily package outlets.

You will note they would prefer an environment with RJR, Lorillard and B&W versus PM. It also
appears directionally their presentations will feature a co-existence theme versus B&W and PM.

Dear Mr. Keniston: ‘7 - ‘-

Thank you very much for your letter concerning our FACT advertising.
We realize that the proper grammatical construction is "I smoke only

'- FACTS" but feel that it does not portray the proper convxction that

our copy line conveys. In order to personalize the choice of brand

to the model being presented in the ad, we have chosen the line "I'm
realistic" and "I only smoke FACTS. " ‘- > . v; . h - - -
Since the subject of the advertisement 15 FACT cigarettes and only
FACT cigarettes, it goes well beyond the connotation of the ad to imply
that the only thing the model does is enjoy our brand of cigarettes.
Our marketing research indicates that consumers reading this adver-
tisement appear to receive exactly the intended connotation in the
communication — that is, that the model portrayed has made an
informed judgment on his brand of cigarettes and has chosen "to
smoke only rACTS. " Our feeling is that the American public has
come to understand over the years that advertisements typically
assume "poetic license" in order to convey their selling messages
and further feel that they can make a dichotomy between advertising
use of language and the exactly proper grammatical construction.

Again, thank you for your letter and we hope that, if you are a smoker,
you will try our FACTS and see if you do not agree that they deliver
atypically good taste for a low 'tar' cigarette.

Since rely,

Dear Dr. Hasim:

I am submitting a grant entitled, "Novel Transcripts involved In
Breast Tumorigenesis“. This grant was previously assigned a
#4520. The new proposal represents a revised version of the
previous grant.

The two reviewers had the following comments on our previous 7
grant (#4520). The first reviewer was extremely enthusiastic abobt
our project. He considered the proposed methodology novel, ,
predicted that it would be successful, and recommended the proje t
for funding. The second reviewer, on the other hand, expressed i
concerns about the P.|.'s expertise in positional cloning approaches.
Per the first reviewer's comment, indeed we have successfully used
positional cloning approaches and cloned BRCAZ gene as proposed in
our previous application. To address the second reviewer's concern
about the P.l.'s expertise in positional cloning approaches we have
enclosed our latest publication describing cloning and identification
of BRCA2 gene. Since the submission of our previous grant
application we have cloned the gene, and hence the revised proposal
has entirely different emphasis, i.e. to characterize the tumor
suppressor activity of BRCA2 gene.

We hope that the reviewers will favorably consider this revised
proposal and give the RI. an opportunity to continue this exciting
area of research

Sincerely yours,

ordered PFD Units and Springfed Package Fixture parts to various warehouses throughout
the US. As some of you may have noticed, these fixtures have negatively impacted your
merchandising budget, if in fact one of these fixtures storage areas falls within your
region/division boundaries. Please note that upon completion of the re—merchandising

Attached is your copy of the Planning Guide. Please study it carefully.
I will be available at your request for a 30-minute follow-up review
(and answer question) meeting with you during the March 14—16 period.

Please note on the attached the excerpt section on the Development of the
External Forecast. Specifically, this involves the procedures and notes

the following areas where we need your Department's inputs. ‘f—EIQﬁ-Ijiﬁggl
/ CL

0 Economic effects of cigarette pricing: My memo of February 22 to £;¢AZJ}it’E;

you is a starting basis for discussion of this. What we need is a
set of retail pricing assumptions and their estimated impact on
industry volume. Jesse Siff of Siff, Oakley & Marks, an outside
consulting economist, is available to work with us, if we desire.

0 Industry unit volume and RJR volume and share: Most critical and

top priority is to update since it indicates how much replanning
against the market share issue is necessary.

We also need to determine if there is a way to make the forecast of

greater operational value to our Manufacturing and Leaf/Blend Develop-
ment Departments.

Manufacturing says what we say we will need and what we actually need
end up to be quite differently. Leaf says because of the 18—24 month
lead time required for leaf buying and leaf processing and storage

(additional storage or expanded processing), a more accurate forecast
is needed.

a Consumer Environment: Consumer values and lifestyles, cigarette categories,

demographics and geographies, competition and consumer attitudes toward
smoking. We need to reassess the marketing implications of current and
changing trends in these areas.

A thorough analysis of competitive strengths and weaknesses is most
important since it may indicate contingent or alternative ways to gain
share of market. The emphasis should be on American, 85W and Ligget::Z;>?
For example, what are the geographic pockets of Liggett's business in "
terms of volume. Can we target more aggressive counter display and
vending efforts in these areas to get their business?

SUBJECT: R.I Perspective on DATE: November 19, 1987
Blind Product Test

T0: W. M. Hildebolt ' FROM: M. F. Dube

The results of a blind product test of fresh aftertaste (FAT) products
were reported on 11/5/87. The management summary provided by MDD is
included as an attachment. The products utilized the recently developed
controlled release pellet technology with a low level of menthol. These
products had measured smoke menthol deliveries of less than 6.5 ug/puff as
compared to approx. 70 ug/puff for Salem Lt. and approx. 45 ug/puff for
Newport. Three low menthol level products were tested, in which pellets
containing 3%, 5% and 7% menthol by weight were inserted in the filter.
No menthol was added via conventional means (i.e. top dressing, filter
flavor). Products were tested among 18 - 49 year old non-menthol Full
Flavor and Full Flavor Low Tar smokers, male and female.

In the FF category, all three products were rated inferior on %70+
acceptance. All three products increased menthol, minty and artificial
taste attributes. As we've seen repeatedly in qualitative work, FF
non-menthol smokers will not accept a product if they can detect menthol.
Further corroboration is provided by an earlier 1987 Concept/Product Test
in which non-menthol smokers were given a concept, stating that "a hint of
menthol" was used in the products. These products were overwhelmingly
rejected.

In the FFLT category, the 5% menthol product was rated parity among total
category and superior among 18 - 24 year old smokers and among smokers
with a high fresh aftertaste ideal. The 3% and 7% menthol products were
rated inferior to the Control among FFLT products with the 3% level
apparently too low and the 7% level too high. For the 5% product, tobacco
taste, strength and harshness attributes were maintained while fresh
aftertaste and cooling aftertaste were increased. Increases in mildness,
menthol, minty and artificial taste were also noticed; however, this
category did not view these attributes negatively as evidenced by the
positive acceptance scores.

These test results are highly encouraging in view of the fact that the
suspected target category for a new product with fresh aftertaste is FFLT,
young adult female smokers. Additionally, the 5% menthol pellet product
was parity among category indicating that its performance was comparable
to existing brands. However, it did have the aftertaste improvement
vehicle which should enhance acceptance in the FFLT category. We expect
to have a product with this technology on the market within the next 12
months.

SUbWCﬂ Status Report NL Project Data February 25, 1976

To: Mr. D. P. Johnson Fronu A. J. Sensabaugh, Jr.

Project No.: 2394

Project Title: NE

Summary:

Regular and menthol NL—type cigarettes have been developed and
submitted to Marketing for their evaluation. These cigarettes were
designed to deliver 17 mg. "tar" and .15 mg. of nicotine. Various
blends, top-dressings,and processing changes were evaluated to reduce
the off taste and off aroma associated with the M-2000 process for
nicotine removal. Although some reduction of the off taste and off
aroma have been accomplished by removing the burley tobacco from the
blend, changing from freon to pentane, modifying M—ZOOO processing
conditions, and improved top-dressing, a definite off taste and off
sidestream aroma in the smoke is still present. The off flavor and
undesirable sidestream aroma are apparently inherent to the M—2000
process.

Future work on this project will depend upon Marketing's
recommendations after evaluating the products that have been submitted.

Memorandum:

Initial testing of various types and grades of tobacco showed that
the MrZOOO process did change the smoking characteristics of the tobaccos.
The processing is more detrimental to burley tobacco than flue-cured
tobacco in that the level of off taste and off aroma are greater. Evaluations
of various grades of tobacco than were M—ZOOO processed showed the stronger
grades reduced in strength and having smoking characteristics closer to
the milder grades. All grades evaluated had a distinct Mr2000 taste and
aroma. All these observations were made using tobaccos processed in the
freon system.

Initial evaluations of WINSTON—type NL cigarettes versus a WINSTON
"Control" showed the WINSTON "Control" numerically favored in flavor

and preference with the NL significantly milder. These results are
shown in Table I.

Products, in the SALEM KS and SALEM Light 85 styles, were
made by Brand RﬁD using cavity filters containing various
levels of menthol laden polymer beads. At their request,
menthol formulations of cut filler application were designed

on 'the analyses obtained from 'the menthol content in 'the
tobacco and the polymer beads. An aging study will be
conducted by Brand R&D on the comparison of these two menthol

SUBJECT: LNA Consumer Tests DATE: April 21, 1989
TO: Dr. M. E. Stowe FROM: J. P. Dickerson

I recommend cancellation of the consumer test for Project LNA-lOP,
scheduled for a 7/31/89 mailout. The LNA-lOV product, which is being mailed
for consumer testing 5/22/89, meets our original objective of obtaining
consumer test data on a "no-nicotine" protocept. The LNA-lOV product has a
blend nicotine of 0.11% and a smoke nicotine yield of 0.05 mg/cigarette.
Although our blend nicotine is 0.11% as compared to 0.05—0.06% in Merit Free

and Next, smoke nicotine in this product is 0.05 mg/cigarette as compared to
0.06 in Merit Free and Next.

The low nicotine in LNA-lOV was obtained through conventional
denicotinization of low nicotine tobaccos. Our approach to the LNA-lOP
product is based on removal of nicotine by a water extraction process. In

theory, the LNA—lOP approach will give approximately the same nicotine value
as the LNA-lOV approach, using tobacco blends in inventory.

If we do proceed with the 7/31/89 consumer test, we will be comparing
the water extraction process with conventional denicotinization. Comparison

of the two processes at best has limited value since the approach to water
extraction is being changed significantly.

Eliminating the proposed consumer test would allow Advanced Process
Technology to concentrate their effort on the water extraction process that

would be used in a production facility rather than diverting resources to
producing material for one consumer test.

I recommend that we continue to evaluate the water extracted material we
have on hand and continue to develop low nicotine formulations from the
materials produced by Advanced Process Technology. However, I feel that we

should delay any consumer tests related to LNA-lOP until we have done a more
thorough job of process and formulation development.

Coalition tor Clean Indoor Air and Health Protection

April '15. 1991

Jack Sweeney. Chairman

El Doredo County Board of Supervisors
33° Fair Lane

Placervlile. CA 95667

Dear Supervisor Sweeney:

Enclosed for your consideration is the dratt smoking ordinance prepared by the Clean Indoor
Air and Health Protection Coalition. Although the draft ordinance passed by a vote of 7-to-1.
we feel that it is important to express the different viewpoints of the committee members. This
latter attempts to present both the majority and minority opinions of our group.

The majority of the members at the committee feel that anything short of an 100 percent
smoke-free ordinance is not favorable to the health and safety of the public. The majority
believe that smoke flows freely from smoking to non-smoking areas. and too percent smoke-
tree la the only way to protect both employees In the workplace and the public at large. The
minority group would rather allow businesses to set their own policies and avoid mandating
policy altogether.

The primary clifierencs of opinion centers around protecting the rights of business owners to
set policy versus protecting the nonsmoking public. The minority position of the committee
believe that since there is no threshold established for the amount of second-hand smoke that
is hazardous. we do not have sufficient basis to establish a 100 percent smoke-free policy.
They feel that each business owner should be allowed to set their own smoking policy. The
majority believe that a threshold Is not necessary. Second-hand smoke has been proven to
be harmful to nonsmokers. In our survey to business owners in El Doredo County. 83 percent
believe that second-hand smoke is hazardous to nonsmokere' health.

Another area oi disagreement Is in the treatment of employees. Many members believe that
all businesses should be treated the some. Allowing smoking sections in restaurants will
expose employees to second-hand smoke, but the ordinance requires all other businesses to
provide smoke-free air for empioyees. Please refer to the attached letter from Betty Turner,
Policy Director of the American Lung Association for further explanation.

Re: JAYS Project

Dear Magen:

The purpose of this letter is to clarify our agreement regarding Brown & Williamson

Tobacco Corporation’s support of your program to reduce youth smoking. Brown &
Williamson is committed to the prevention of tobacco use among teenagers and children,

and thus is pleased to pledge support for your JAYS Project in the amount of $30,000,

The following terms and conditions shall apply to our agreement:

(1) Brown & Williamson understands that the program will be implemented and
conducted according to the general terms outlined in the Project Proposal, dated
April 30, 1998. As a condition to providing funds, Brown & Williamson reserves the
right to immediately withdraw such funding (and you agree to return any funds
previously provided and not yet committed) in the event that the Project is

implemented or conducted in a manner which varies from the description of the
project in the above referenced Proposal.

(2) In connection with this project, Brown & Williamson may wish to provide
educational materials, logos, or other promotional items to participants for the
purpose of supporting the youth smoking cessation/youth smoking avoidance goals
of the program if you wish to use them. However, Brown & Williamson stipulates
that its name only be used on such logos or other program materials which Brown &
Williamson has approved in advance. You further agree that you will not use Brown
& Williamson’s name in connection with the Project in any public statement, whether
oral or written, in the event Brown & Williamson withdraws funding in accordance
with the above paragraph.

(3) You agree and acknowledge that Brown & Williamson has the right to publicize its
support for the Project.

(4) You agree to provide Brown & Williamson with quarterly written reports detailing
the results achieved under the Project programs.

INTEROFFICE MEMORANDUM

     

Subject: Strip & Cut Filler Processing Date: March 1, 1984

Committee - Meeting Minutes

To: Committee Members From: H..C. Threatt

The group previously calling itself the “Maximizing Acceptable Cigarettes
per Pound" Committee met February 29, 1984. Those attending were Hoyt Beard,
Jim Dickerson, Wayne Fulp, Bobby Hardin, Floyd Lockamy, Don Lamonds, John
McKenzie, Jim Phillips, Dan Pugh, and Harold Threatt. The agenda for the
meeting is attached (see Attachment 1).

I. Previou§_Meeting Minutes

There were no changes to the minutes of the last meeting.

11. Project_£i§£

The committee discussed the updated project list, a copy of which is
included with these minutes. Several good points were made for improving the
list:

Clarify ST (short term) and LT (long term)

Place the date on the list
Update in time to have a newly revised list for each meeting

Number the pages.

The group felt that several areas not presently involved should receive
copies of the list - Leaf Buying, Leaf Processing, and Facilities Development,
for example. Copying the Leaf and Blends Subcommittee members will be a big
help in getting proper distribution.

Actions required in maintaining the project list are:

1. Corrections/changes need to be sent to Harold Threatt by March 14.
2. Latest corrected project list to be sent to committee members by

March 21.
3. Committee members should come prepared to address any errors at
March 28 meeting.

III. "Maker" Projects From Manufacturing Engineering

Don Lamonds attended the meeting for the first time. The committee felt
that it would be good to include projects in Manufacturing Engineering having
to do with maker improvements. Don will provide these for addition to the
list. His projects are mainly quality related, but they fit the criterion
because of the reduction in the number of rejects, etc.

John Cunningham, Esq.
Assistant to the Director

WashingtOn, D.C.

Dear John:

It appears to be universal practice for cigarette companies w
. advertise in Spanish display the required health warnings in English.
I am enclosing several advertisements taken from current Spanish
publications such as El Diario, ABC de las Americas, and Temas.
In addition, I saw a lighted display sign in a subway station
advertising Kent cigarettes in Spanies, with the warning in tiny
English letters.

Six cigarette companies are covered by the consent orders
which the FTC accepted on March 30, 1972 (Lorillard, Docket No. C—Zl80;
Phillip Morris Inc., Docket No. C—2181; American Brands, Inc.,

Docket No. C—2182; Brown and Williamson Tobacco Corporation, Docket
NO. C-2183; R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, DOCket No. 0-2184; and,
Digget & Myers Incorporated, DOCket NO. C-2185).

. They will certainly argue that their conduct is in
precise compliance with the letter of the agreement, which specifies
the exact wording of the health warning. The companies_agreed to:

Cease and desist from adVUrtising any

such cigarette unless respondent makes ...
clear and conspicuous disclosure of the
statement prescribed in Section 4 of the
Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act of 1969
(Public Law 91-222) which reads:

Our new pnoing effectively creates two price tiers for our products. premium and discount. All brand styles
within each pricing tier (regularlKing/toolt 20) will be priced the same. We suggest that you consult with your
cigarette supplier or chain headquarters for complete details of price changes that may have resulted frOm

_ it is recommended that you sell through on-hand higher priced inventories prior to rolling back your retail
prices to consumers. We also suggest you reset your price for all brand styles in the premium and discount
categories at one time. thereby eliminating confusion tor both store personnel and customers. Instead oi
trying to target a certain date. our objective is that you have maximum ﬂexibility in resetting your prices as‘
most appropriate for you based upon your store' s inventory situation

We will not offer a retail participation/inventory protection program. Each retailer is in the best position to
tailor its pricing strategies to ﬁt Its particular inventory levels, and it would be extremely difficult for us to
audit the inventory oi over 300. 000 retail outlets and offer a fair reconciliation of on hand inventory.

During the week of August 2. 1993. you will receive rollback polnt-of- -sale materials to use in communicating
your new lower prices to your customers.

Dear Mr. Nishimura:

It was a pleasure having you visit RJR on your busy schedule
through the U.S. It was especially gratifying to have several
RJR management members meet a long-time friend of our Company
and to engage in theihelpful exchange of information on ciga-’
rette manufacturing. You represented JTS very well.

During your visit, the question was asked about RJR's response
to U.S. government request for list of additives used in ciga-
rette manufacture. This is a very sensitive matter and one
which at this writing is still unresolved. However, we can
say that the U.S. cigarette manufacturers have negotiated an
agreement with the Department of Health and Human Services
whereby the industry will disclose substances commonly added
during the cigarette manufacturing process and HHS has agreed
to treat such disclosure as CONFIDENTIAL under the Freedom of

Information Act.

I am pleased to enclose a photograph taken during our lunch

401 North Main Street
Winston—Salem, N.C. 27102

Dear Mr. Dean:

For the past seven years I have run a successful sampling
program for R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company aimed at up—scale
adult audiences in Manhattan and Long Islands' finest hotels

and clubs.

I was informed today that the hotel sampling program will not
be continued for 1988 and was concerned that perhaps it was
mistakenly included when programs which could be criticized
for possible exposure to teenagers were eliminated. There
have been recent competitive developments which lead me to
believe the competition is increasing their emphasis on New
York hotel sampling. And the painful truth is that should

we drop our affiliation with these hotels it may be impossible
to regain them should Reynolds' change its direction in the
future. This hotel sampling program would be an ideal vehicle
for the launch of the new smokeless cigarette we plan for 1988.

The best reason for keeping the program is the cost. This year
we will distribute 750,000 sample packs at a total cost of $153,900

or nineteen’cents a pack, not including the cost of product.
This successful promotion in the most coveted of marketplaces

has far-reaching sales potential.

Our major competitor in the hotel sampling program is Philip Morris
who has held this program on—line since 1970. We consistently run
into their samplers at a number of properties that we sample, as
Philip Morris has involvement with a number of affiliations here

in this important market. Indeed we have held a preemptive position

versus the competition because we sample seven days a week.

Yesterday, for the first time, we encountered Lorillard at the
Sheraton—Center Hotel sampling "Newports" at the International

Hospitality Ball.

Re: Toplines of Menthol Date: July 18, 1988
Migration Study: Interleaved
vs. Direct Application

Backgrogng/Pgrggsg:

The Menthol Developmental Group is exploring the direct application of menthol
onto the carbon sheet as an alternative to the current interleaving process
(I). The level of menthol migration to the fuel source is one of the criteria

by which this decision will be made.

The Shelf Life_6roup assisted by evaluating and comparing menthol migra-
tion to the fuel sources of products incorporating the Interleaving-vs.’the~

direct Application processes.

Procedure:

Cartons of Menthol Alpha products 8040A (Interleaved) and 80408 (Direct) were
exposed to 75 F and 120 F conditions for five days. Menthol determinations
of all components were made at 0, 1, 3, and 5 days. An informal sensory test

was performed at Day 5.

Beadle muiﬂiaaesuuu

As shown in Attachment 1., results from this study suggested menthol migration
to the fuel source is greater for products incorporating the interleaving vs.
direct application processes when these products are exposed to either 75 F

75 F or 120 F conditions.

However, it is known that the base sheet used to make 8040 had a ldwer carbon
activity than the sheet’used to make earlier successful prototypes, 80020 and
80128. In order to achieve a similar menthol load as the tobacco paper plug

' plug used in these prototypes, 4 days of/interleaving were required (vs.
2 days) for 8040A...This resulted in excessive free menthol which would be

available for migration and possibly bias the results of this test of direct
vs. interleaving processes. Therefore, this study will be repeated with the
correct carbon activity base sheet.

Next 5199::

This study will be repeated w/o 7-18-88 using products contaiﬂgng tobacco paper
plugs with‘172 Carbon (with an activity 4.4 gms./ sq. metenTﬁ'

SUBJECT: The Archer Company -
of January 25, 1988

e kly Activity Report for Week

1. Genesis Packaging - TAC's peelab e retortable lidding structure is
the material of choice at Genes 5, who requested 3MM square inches
for further machine evaluations. Genesis has sold two machines for
applying our flexible membranes to their plastic barrier containers
and retorting products to replace metal cans. One machine is at
National Food Laboratories; the other machine's location is
confidential. Genesis and TAG management will meet during the
second quarter to coordinate efforts geared for production
quantities early 1989.

2. Polaroid - A management/technical team from Polaroid is visiting
TAC 1726-27/88 to review the technical issues on modifying their
structure for one mil pod foil to enable TAC to receive a 500%
permanent increase in business. One mil pod is presently produced
on a unique multi-faustel laminator that is already at capacity and
Polaroid desires to have the new structure approved by 10/1/88.
Both companies are working to make the opportunity happen.

3. Campbell (Plastigon Program - Retortable Soups) - TAC's lidding
material (utilizing a proprietary sealant film produced on the
oriented film line at the pilot plant) has just passed U.S.D.A.
protocol testing. Material to be tested at their Maxton, NC plant
this week. The Plastigon program will leapfrog Campbell into new
technology and markets.

4. Miles Laboratories - After three price negotiation sessions, we
have still not resolved our 1/1/88 price. Our cost increases
justified a price increase proposal of 7.75%. Miles countered with
an offer of 2.0%. We have countered with a 5.5% price increase for
$4MM of business and a 5.0% increase for $5MM of business. We

expect to settle on the latter and and finalize this agreement by
1/29/88. ’ a

5. Converter Foil Pricing - Alcoa has announced a price increase of 6%
to be effective on all new orders and on existing orders shipped
after 4/18/88. We will support this increase and advise our
customers that our prices have increased by 6% effective on and
after 4/18/88. This action will also precipitate a general price
increase on our foil-bearing converted products, and TAC Marketing
will determine the level and timing of this increase.

6. 'TAC's Northeast Sales office has relocated from Long Island to

Wilton, Connecticut. Ralph Klein, Sales Manager, expects to have a
secretary hired the week of 2/2/88.

110 East 59th Street

New York, N. Y. 10022

Dear Dr. Sommers:

I would like to clarify some aspects of the Research project which we submitted
to the Council for Tobacco Research, in an attempt to demonstrate that our project is
directly concerned with an area of cancer research which your organization is interested

in supporting, i.e., the pathogenic mechanisms of oncogenesis and their control, as
relates particularly to chemical carcinogenesis.

We feel that the immune mechanism is far more efficient in preventing the develop—
ment of malignancies than in destroying well established growing tumors. The develop-
ment of many tumors may indeed be considered, at least in part, as the result of failure
of the cellular immunity defense against tumor specific antigens. In these situations,
either the least antigenic malignant cells may be permitted to grow and thus escape
immune defenses, or humoral antibodies may block specific cellular immunity.

Considerable experimental evidence has been obtained in support of the considera-
tions described above. As reported by ourselves and Dr. Old several years ago, it is
relatively easy to demonstrate the increased resistance to tumor induction afforded by
agents which stimulate the immune system, such as BCG but impossible to obtain favorable
results with this type of treatment when the tumors are well established.

Our purpose is to devise better methods of enhancing the immunological reactivity
of host to weak tumor antigens and better techniques of stimulating selectively cellular
immunity while depressing undesirable humoral immunity. Thus we plan to significantly
decrease the rate of appearance of tumors induced by chemical carcinogens as well as
increase the time after which they appear. We plan to use inbred mice for these studies
rather than guinea pigs which we used for our studies on protection against leukemia
because the mouse is clearly the animal of choice for these experiments. In addition,
parallel with these studies in mice, the appearance of antibody against known viral
oncogenic agents can be monitored in the sera of the experimental animals. We propose
to use several inbred strains of micelBALB/c, C57, 03H, and AKR and the following
carcinogens, 3-methylcholanthrene and 3,4,—9,lO-dibenzpyrene. We plan to paint or
inject the carcinogen in graded doses to mice which will be subjected to various pro—
cedures designed to affect the immune system and its reactivity, such as graft vs host
reactions, treatment with certain bacteria] extracts that have demonstrable adjuvant
effects for cellular immunity. We will then observe the rate of appearance of the
tumor in the population.

In conjunction with these experiments, it seems important to us to develop a
deeper understanding of the mechanisms by which the immune system manages to reject

Dear Bob:

Thanks for sending me the note about the 'yes's "
and "no's". Alonglwith several from our staff, it
should make a really good ‘conference. Will you send out
the notices to the members of the S. A. B. and then let
me know how many oi‘ the staff are coming. Within the
next day or two, I will go to the Benson Hotel, which is
not far from the Institute, and make arrangements for the
nunber which are coming, namely about 12. I will then
write to each one of the participants, telling them it
they come by train to alight at North Philadelphia Station
and take a taxicab. If, at the airport, to take a taxicab
from there. If on the other hand, I know the arrival time
alone or more, we may be able to meet them with the
station wagon of the Institute or my car. I will tell
them to keep an account of eXpenses and send them in to
you or give them to you at the meeting.

I am planning a luncheon via caterer at the
Institute and a little dinner in the evening. Most will
come, no doubt, on Friday and stay overnight that evening.

Some will nodoubt go straight home. Others may stay
over until Saturday morning.

I have asked Dr. Tom King of the Institute to sound

the key note opening after Tim Talbot welcomes them, and
so will I and you.

We will have blackboards and projection outfits if
anyone wants to bring slides, etc.

hope you arrived safe home from Fort Lauderdale,
where we certainly had a good time and got some work done.

:e went to Miami for a couple of days and then took the train

SUBJECT: KOOL MILDS 100: COMPETITIVE PRODUCT TEST RESULTS

The following provides results of Kool Milds 100's performance in the latest

SALEM Lights 100 competitive test. This competitive wave was to be the first
test of a nationally manufactured improved SALEM Lights 100 product against
its new action standard competitor, Kool Milds 100. However, the SALEM Lights
100 product picked up for this test was rejected due to low tar. Therefore,

only ratings for Kool Milds are available since past competitive waves tested
the previous SALEM Lights 100 product.

Results from Wave III, due in early November, will provide the next
opportunity to confirm the competitive status of the new SALEM Lights 100
product.

OVERALL ACCEPTANCE

Kool Milds 100's overall acceptance ratings are extremely low among both
competitive and franchise smokers.

Alternate Puffing Methods: Pentane Batch Processor

Purpose: '

To compare tobacco that was not puffed, tobacco processed through
the continuous FC~11 system, tobacco processed through the pentane batch

processor, and tobacco processed on the pentane porous belt, and to evaluate
the 6—13 pentane batch processor.

1

Summary:

G-13A from the same lot was processed through the continuous FC-ll
system at No. 601, through the pentane batch processor, and the pentane
porous belt. Cigarettes were made using tobacco from each process and

unpuffed G-lBA, and using the WINSTON LIGHT 84 blend containing the four
G~13A types as replacement for regular G~13A.

The cigarette weight reduction using the FC-ll processed tobacco was
greater than either pentane method, using 100 percent G—13A (44 vs. 38%).
Weight reduction of the tobacco rods using the blend was 7.4 percent for
FC~11, 6.1 percent for batch, and 7.6 percent for the belt processed G~13A.
Draft was much higher for the FC~11 processed G-lBA’than for the pentane

processed tobacco. Chemical analyses showed higher nicotine loss and lower
sugar loss for the belt method than the FC~11 or batch. TPM, "Tar", and

nicotine in the smoke was lower for the FC~ll process than either pentane
method. Essential oils analyses indicated that the pentane batch process
was less severe, the FC—ll process was intermediate, and the pentane belt

process was most severe. Smoking panel evaluation did not reveal superiority
for any process over the other.

The pentane batch processor requires two hours cycle time and pressures
approaching 90 psia to produce tobacco puffed,about equivalent to that
produced in the FC«11 continuous process.‘ The pentane batch puffing system
is technically feasible; the liquid jet evacuation system does not appear to
be. The system would be labor intensive and present safety hazards.

Recommendations:

 

If pentane investigations continue:

1. Study the feasibility of a continuous belt system with remote control.

RE: Marlboro Media Plan

Attached is an excellent compilation of Marlboro's 1986 media plan and
key learning/conclusions relative to this formidable competitor's
media strategies/tactics. The information was compiled and analyzed
by Gabe Gabriel and is illustrated in a standard RJR plan deck format.

As Gabe concludes, Marlboro's media activity is extraordinarily broad
and extensive — a mass media schedule befitting a dominant—share brand
with appeal transcending focused demographic parameters.

lmportantly, it appears the media schedule is not designed to address
Marlboro's FUBYA strength but, rather, to maintain its ubiquitous

presence against total smokers, thereby defending its business against
smokers likely to switch out of the franchise.

This strategy is similar to RJR's in that neither Marlboro nor RJR
primarily concentrate efforts against franchise smokers. The key
difference is the direction in which the brands view their opportunity
segments. Marlboro's focus appears to be franchise maintenance as
their smokers grow older in age. Conversely, RJR's focus is against
younger adult smokers who may be brought into the franchise.

_BE_M____X~_M__.____ _~t .lP y

Marlboro Franchise -———-—-——~—€> Older Adult

With your approval, next steps are to distribute Gabe's analysis to
the CAMEL, WINSTON and MAGNA Brand Groups, as well as Media Planning,
for their review and an enlightening look at the specific tactical
activity behind Marlboro's known high spending levels.

Let us know if you would like to discuss.

Aluminum Metal Substrate

MEMO:

It was found that conventional substrate materials have a small pore
size on the order of a few hundred angstroms. These substrates; alumina.
bauxite, carbon, etc.; allow the aerosol generating and flavor materials to
be released slowly. This is evidenced by the fact of discovery of black
(carbonized centers) in alumina pellets which have been subjected to
smoking conditions and by Ames test activity with these substrates when
subjected to high temperature conductive heat. These conditions allow
for formation of decomposition products and increased generation of carbon
monoxide. In order to provide a larger pore size, substrate materials were
formed from aluminum metal mesh and sheet. Larger substrate pore sizes
should result in decreased carbon monbxide and decomposition products.

Example 1 - Aluminum wire 200 x 200 mesh, containing .0021" diameter

wire was rolled into a spiral. The beginning size was 5/8" wide x 60 mm
long.

60””

    

0,0. '075" '08{

Two of these substrate rods were made and dipped into liquid glycerine at
a temperature near the boiling point. One of the rods weighed .1003 g

before dipping and .1820 g after dipping. Thus, .0817 g of glycerine was
deposited on the aluminum spiral rod. The other spiral rod weighed .1251

g before dipping and .2542 3 after. thus, .1291 g of glycerine was deposited

on the rod. \ xw i/IK/YI

RE: Event Sponsorship - "Johnny Canales Show" - Concert

BACKGROUND

On Sunday, October 22, 1989 the taping of the Johnny Canales show will be
open to the public in Corpus Christi. Johnny Canales is the Tejano version
of Johnny Carson who has a live entertainment show over all Univision
stations featuring Tejano a ' ts. His show has a massive grass roots
appeal and his audience is éfjjnetely our target market.

The proceeds from those attending will go to benefit the local Boys and

Girls Clubs. Estimated attendance is 10,000. Although the show will be taped
for a later airing date, there is no problem with our participation. We

did the same type of event here in Houston in June to benefit the National
Hispanic Scholarship Fund, and it was very successful.

RECOMMENDATION

I am recommending participation in this event.

RAT IONALE

Participation in this event will provide the Camel Brand with extensive
exposure in Corpus Christi's Hispanic market in a relatively slow promotional
period. In addition, participation in this event will provide the brand with

an opportunity to:

Sample our target market

Distribute our premiums

Display our banners and inflatables

Set up our Camel Video Van - show our videos
Include our logo in print publicity

ital-IPX-X-

This will also provide us with a good event for this market which has not
been to active in promotional events.

Dear Mr. Oldaker,

I read your recent letter to Dave Tott telling of your past association with
Art Yorozu. You also described your analytical model predicting levels
of contaminates in B727 aircraft cabins, and requested detailed
information on the B727 ventilation, air velocities and leakage rates.

We appreciate your need to improve the accuracy of your analytical model
by obtaining the described detailed information. Unfortunately, the
limited amount of information that we may be able to provide you would
be of little use. All information on air velocities, ventilation rates and

l leakage rates for the B727 is for new production aircraft. These values
could change significantly as a function of interior configuration, aircraft
service life and maintenance history. The test data you mentioned,
obtained from measurements within aircraft cabins, is most likely your
best source of information today.

I'm sorry we cannot meet your needs. Please feel free to contact me at

Introduction

Nearly 10,000,000 children less than titre years of age. living intthe, United
States are exposed involuntarily to environmental tobaooosmoke (ETS)iathome.1
. Twenty-five percent of pregnant women continue to smoke throughout their . .
pregnancy. Although the overall rate of smoking in us. society has been decreasing
during the two and one-half decades since the Surgeon General's report on the
adverse effects of tobacco, the exposure risk to young Children. particularly those living
in low income or black families, remains at 50-60 percent. ‘ “‘ ‘

Involuntary exposure to ETS affects children in three different ways. First, pre-
natal exposure potentlally can have a marked impact on totalybody‘ development
including lung. brain, and size development. Additionally, premature delivery and
spontaneous abortion are related to maternal smoking. Second, post-nataliy the
growing child may have effects of ETS which impact on the heart. iungs,‘{_lmmUne
system, ears, brain, and even survival itself. Third, and possibly mostnimportant.
childhood exposure to ETS impacts on the child's decision to engage in‘actliIe
smoking and other self-injurious medical behaviors 2 which meet likelywill continue
into adulthood and will compound the effects of perinatal ETS exposure. . 2

Non-Respiratory Effects

The potentially injurious effects of ETS on a child's health are? both non-
respiratory and respiratory. Although the recently described correlation between ETS .
and blood cholesterol in children is significant 3, the non-respiratory effect that maybe
. most important is the relationship between ET S and sudden .infant'dea‘th syndrome4 -
or SIDS - because mortality from SIDS during childhood is potentially preventible.

Research Problem

I. Background — We are investigating the biological and biochemical
aspects of herpesvirus oncogenesis by employing three related equine
herpesviruses (EHV) which have proven to be ideal model systems as the
three viruses share DNA sequences but differ markedly in biological
activities (see review provided, O'Callaghan er al., 1978). In the last
year we have shown that UV-irradiated virus or standard virus preparations
enriched for defective interfering (DI) particles will transform primary
hamster (inbred LSH) embryo cells, and several cell lines transformed by
each of these herpesviruses have been established. We have demonstrated
that the EHV—l and EHV—2 (cytomegalovirus) cell lines are oncogenically
transformed and have established numerous tumor cell lines from the

tumor tissues (malignant fibrous sarcomas that metastasize to lung, heart,
bone, and CNS); the EHV—3 transformed cells have been inoculated into
hamsters within the last two weeks.

In the case of the EHV—l system, DNA hybridization analyses have shown
that cells of transformed cell lines, tumor tissues, and tumor cell lines
harbor viral DNA sequences (3—202 of the genome; 0.3-4.0 copies/cell).

Some of these viral genes are retained even after prolonged (+100 passages)
passage in either cell culture or in the animal (transplantable tumors),

and the expression of these viral DNA sequences has been shown by l) demon-
stration of antibody to EHV—l proteins in the sera of tumor bearing hamsters
and 2) detection of viral structural and nonstructural proteins in the cell
membranes and perinuclear space by immunofluorescence. Presently, blot
hybridization analyses are being carried out in which individual restriction
endonuclease fragments (labeled to high specific activity by nick translation)
are being employed to identify and quantitate the specific EHV—l genomic

Dear Dr. Hockett:

Thank you very much for the privilege of reading this manuscript. 1
return it to you herewith and also enclose a copy of a recent article that has
some interesting and apparently contradictory findings, namely that the VST
returns to normal within a short time after experimental ligation of a coronary
artery.

I am still very much disturbed with the clinical implication of
this manuscript. As I wrote previously, the audience and the reader is con-
ditioned to accept the results without recognizing that the experiments
possibly lack clinical relevance. Thus.

(1) The authors point out that the Framingham study found that sudden
death from coronary artery disease was four times as high in the heavy smoker as
is the non~smoker. The authors also point out that the9 nost likely cause for
sudden death is ventricular fibrillation.

Hhat the authors fail to state is that neither the Framingham group
nor any other group found that sudden death from coronary artery disease occurs
predominantly while smoking or sooner after smoking. If this were so, there would
be little difficulty in proving cause and effect. On the contrary, the temporal
relation between smoking and sudden death has never been documented. Indeed all
evidence, at least within the hospital and within the Coronary Care Unit, indi-
cates that ventricular fibrillation with or without sudden death occurs without
immediate antecedent smoking. The experimental temporal relation therefore has
no counter part in clinical medicine. I do believe that these points should be
discussed and stressed in this article.‘

Dear Dr. Stone,

The Radiation Research Society is holding its thirty—seventh annual
meeting in Seattle, on March 18—23,1988. The Society is by far the biggest
of its type in the world, and typically has more than 1000 participants at
the annual meeting. One of the sessions, which I have been asked to
organise, is a Workshop on "The Interaction Between Radon Exposure and
Smoking." A brief description of the workshop, and the participants, is
enclosed, the former to be included in the conference program book. In
light of our phone conversation, it would be most helpful and extremely
app1opriate if the Council for Tobacco Research could sponsor the seminar,
in terms of a contribution of, say, $2500, towards the tiavel expenses of
the participants. An appropriate acknowledgement would, of course, appear
in the conference program.

Closer to home, our own laboratory has been doing a considerable amount
of research into the biological effects of radon in vitro, and is planning
to do some experiments with alpha particles simulating radon daughters and
with tobacco smoke condensate, to look for possible synergistic interactions
- which would imply that the hazard of radon + smoking is larger than the
sum of the hazards from radon alone and smoking alone. Our end point will
he in—vitro oncogenic transformation. As our experience with tobacco smoke
condensate is limited, would you be interested in coming to give us a
seminar — or a more informal discussion — on tobacco research in general?
Our laboratory has a seminar series, and a small honorarium is usual.

I enclose our laboratory annual report, and my own C.V., to give you a
feel for the scope of our activities. Please feel free to give me a call,

With best regards,

I)";

Dear Dr. Relman:

I have enclosed two copies of a manuscript entitled "A Cigarette
That Heats Rather than Burns Tobacco: Chemical and Biological
Studies" by J. D. deBethizy, M. F. Borgerding, D. J. Doolittle,
J. H. Robinson, K. T. McManus, C. A. Rahn, R. A. Davis, G. T.
Burger, J. H. Reynolds and A. W. Hayes that we would like you to
consider for publication in the New England Journal of Medicine.
The manuscript has been approved by all of the authors.

Our manuscript describes a series of studies which evaluated the
smoke chemistry and biological activity of a cigarette that heats
rather than burns tobacco which was developed by R. J. Reynolds
Tobacco Company. The significant findings reported were large
reductions in the yields of many chemicals from the new cigarette
and that these reductions were associated with a reduction in
urine mutagenicity in smokers. A recent editorial by Dr. Neal A.
Benowitz that appeared in the June 15, 1989 issue of the Journal
called for a "worldwide attempt to reduce the yields of toxic
substances and to make the yield of all cigarettes as low as
possible." Our studies demonstrate that a cigarette that heats

rather than burns tobacco can achieve substantial reductions in
the yields of many compounds.

The manuscript has been reviewed by Dr. Peter Dews from Harvard
Medical School, Dr. Robert Neal from Vanderbilt and Dr. Martin
Cline from the UCLA School of Medicine. All three reviewers felt
that the studies described in this manuscript would be of great
interest to the vast majority of medical professionals. They
wholeheartedly recommended that we submit the paper to the New
England Journal of Medicine.

We suggest the following reviewers based on their experience and

Dear David:

I enjoyed talking to you about our work at the ICEM meeting in Melbourne. I am convinced
from our work that a low antioxidant level in semen is a major risk factor for damage to sperm DNA
and consequent birth defects and childhood cancer in offspring. Since smoking is a very efﬁcient way
to lower antioxidant levels. I expect that smoking will primarily damage sperm DNA through that
mechanism. Our review of the epidemiology appears to bear this out. I enclose our Pittsburgh paper,
where we make this case. We will continue this work to make the case as strong as we can. If
smoking is only working through lowering antioxidants then supplementation with antioxidants should
reverse all of the deleterious effects on the next generation. I think this is extremely important to know
and I am committed to ﬁnding it out ,

If you wish to collaborate with us by collecting sperm samples from smokers and non-smokers
in your company that would be very useful in speeding up the study as it is hard for us to ﬁnd smokers
locally. If you wish to add in a group of smokers of your presumptive safe cigarette to compare to
regular smokers and non—smokers. we would be agreeable to that. That might beneﬁt you and would
not be much extra work for us. If you are interested in this type of collaboration and would agree to
unimpeded publication of the results, however they came out, we would be enthusiastic about going
ahead. We would ﬁnance our end and you would do the same on your end. We believe that this is
work that will have a major impact on health and that it is extremely important to do as soon as
possible.

Your letter was quite convincing that the government is not subsidizing tobacco farmers.

SUBJECT: INVENTION DISCLOSURE DATE: November 26, 1984

To: Mr. G. M. Myers FROM: James L. Resce

Extended Puff Count, Lower C0 Delivery And Improved Conductive

Heat Transfer In TGA Models Using A Macrocapsule With Thermally
Conductive Aluminum "Fingers"

Summary

 

The conductionnof heat from the burning fuel source in a TGA
model back to the substrate (and tobacco) via an aluminum
macrocapsule can be improved with the use of aluminum "fingers"
which extend out from the macrocapsule and surround the fuel
source. These fingers are actually part of the capsule but extend
the length of the fuel source thus providing a ready path for the
conduction of heat. Furthermore, this improved heat transfer
serves to sink out more heat from the burning fuel thus lowering
its.combustion temperature. The result is two-fold: (1) the rate
of carbon gasification is reduced and as a result the fuel is
consumed at a slower rate, and (2) the production of C0 via
carbonaceous reduction of CO is decreased because of the lower
temperature maintained in the burning coal.

Background

Conductive heat transfer in a TGA model from a burning fuel
source back to the substrate occurs chiefly through the aluminum
macrocapsule. The fuel source is generally”inserted only 1 or 2
mm inside the macrocapsule. The heat must travel from the burning
fire cone, down the unburnt fuel rod and then across the l to 2 mm
interface to the capsule. By improving the efficiency of this
conductive heat transfer, more heat can be delivered to the
substrate, sooner, thus permitting earlier flavor and/or aerosol
delivery. The approach taken in this invention is to improve the
interface between fuel source and macrocapsule. In this regard, a
new type of macrocapsule is used which contains a number of
finger-like protrusions which extend the length of the fuel
source. The heat is transferred not only at the interface where

the fuel scurce is inserted into the capsule but also along these

MARLIN APRIL TOPLINE REPORT

The MARLIN Topline Report covering the April period was issued on May 30.

Performance Overview:

Industry Full Price/Savings mix held about ﬂat in April. Retail performance of most
companies was also stable month-to-month.

RJR’s Full Price performance was in line with expectations. We experienced continued slight
SOM and SOFP softness related to increased retail presence on Marlboro, continued high

levels of competitive Branded Savings discounting, and less aggressive discounting activity
than anticipated on our own key FP brands.

RIR’s Savings business stayed on trend from March to April, with slight growth on DORAL
partially offsetting continued softness on MONARCH and BEST VALUE.

Outlook:

We don’t expect to see any change in our FP performance in May. We have no national
workplan activities on CAMEL/SELECT for May and we’ll continue to be impacted by the
same competitive factors that contributed in April.

Our Savings business in total will also likely remain somewhat soft, but DORAL is expected
to gain share in May as retail support (BSGSF) increases.

Given the MARLIN audit schedule for the May period, retail data for May is expected to
show little, if any, impact from the PM product recall.

Dear Mr. Cullman:

The Veterans Administration, the American Cancer Society and Doctors Auerbach and
Hammond cannot accede to the requesu stated in your letter of February 27 and March 20 for an
evaluation of the Auerbach-Harnmond study on “The Eﬁects of Cigarette Smoking Upon Dogs” by a
panel of independent scientists chosen by you.

Your request is without precedent in the scientiﬁc community. The study under question was the
result of three and a half years of diligent and brilliant work by two eminently qualiﬁed scientists
whose ﬁndings have been validated by distinguished pathologists of worldwide reputation. In addition,
other leading pathologists, highly regarded by the scientiﬁc community, have visited Dr. Auerbach’s
laboratory, seen his slides and praised the work.

We do not intend to ask that these two eminent men submit their ﬁndings to any selected
committee chosen by the Tobacco Institute, or any other group. Their work will be judged in the
traditional manner of American science, where ﬁndings are presented, discussed, accepted or rejected
by scientisu and physicians whose only motivation is the truth. Doctors Auerbach and Hammond
worked freely and without restraint with funds furnished by the federal government and the American
Cancer Society. They are beholden only to the scientiﬁc community at large and to the integrity
it represenu. .

If the Tobacco Institute, or any scientiﬁc research group, has doubts about the ﬁndings of this
study, the way it was conducted, or the credentials of the investigators, there is a time-honored and
scientiﬁcally accepted way to proceed. Let your own or another group of scientists repeat the '
experimenu in a laboratory to prove that smoking dogs will not suffer tissue damage, emphysema and
lung cancer. The Auerbach-Hammond methodology is readily available to you. And I presume that
in the Council for Tobacco Research you have or can set up the mechanism for conducting such a study.

If you carry out your plan to publicize "our respective positions" to the medical and lay public,
you have our permission to use this letter as the position paper of the American Cancer Society.

BRIGHT Retail Shelf Life Study

Two samples of BRIGHT (November 1982 and June 1983) were
picked up from retail along with SALEM Ultra Light 85 (November
1982 and May 1983). Separate diagnostic tests were conducted
to evaluate the effects of aging on the two brands. The BRIGHT
products showed differences on seven of the fourteen attributes.
Of particular interest were less menthol flavor, minty flavor
and cooling sensation. SUL 85 showed differences on three of
the fourteen attributes. None of these were menthol related.
The results were provided to Brands and have been reported to
Marketing by them.

Garniture Injection

Implementation of garniture injection on NOW 100 Menthol
has been postponed due to product relocation in Manufacturing.
An AR for this change is being routed. '

Reducing Casing for 6-13-14

Completed MDD (M/A/R/C) tests indicated that franchise
smokers could not discriminate either test formula: (1) with
50% of the 6-13 casing removed from the control or (2) with
50% of casing transferred from 6-13-14 to Part II. Seven major
brands were tested. Cost estimates have been requested to be
completed by July 25.

An AR prOposing the 50% casing reduction on all G-13-14
has been put on hold pending a review of all G-13 projects.

RE: M2 CREATIVE FOCUS GROUPS

 

The following summarizes the findings from the M2 Creative
Focus Groups conducted in Dallas on August 25—28. A more
comprehensive report of findings is expected from the group
moderator the week of September 15th.

BACKGROUND

Research efforts to date have indicated that Virginia Slims
smokers are perceived to be most like the desired perceptions

of the M2 target (independent, self—confident, action—oriented).
The major deficit associated with Virginia Slims smokers is

the perception of not being warm/friendly. This deficiency
results in a number of M2 target women perceiving Virginia Slims
smokers.to be "pushy, plaStic, uncaring".

Initial creative efforts for M2 included a range of alternative

executions from "product— as— hero" to total imagery approaches.
However, it was not known whether these executions projeCted
the independence, self— confidence, active orientation desired
by the target, while retaining the elements of warmth/friendli—

ness.

OBJECTIVES

In order to be retained for further consideration as an M2
executional approach, test executions were to project the
following:

1. WOmen shown in the ads must be perceived as independent,
_self—confident, action—oriented individuals who are also
warm and friendly.

2. Executions must maintain some tie to the SALEM “High
Country" ads, but be seen as different enough to communi-

cate that M2 is a new branc.

GROUP COMPOSITION

Six group sessions were conducted among female smokers of 100mm
menthol brands. Two groups were comprised of Virginia Slims

égéémwj Several weeks ago we discussed the pOSSlblllty of

. . your school district using the materials produced by
nmmemmmmmmmmm the Family C.O.U.R.S.E. Consortium. I sent to you a

mannwmmMe copy of the booklet, "Tobacco: Helping Youth Say No"
and a videotape of the public service announcements

that would send a message to parents that you join in
the effort to eliminate youth smoking.

I wonder if you have had a chance to review these
materials that we are providing to school districts at
no cost. .Assuming that your schedule gets no lighter
after the first of the year, I have taken the liberty
to provide you with a form to facilitate your response.
Would you please take a moment to complete the form and
mail it to me at the address below or FAX it to

202/393-4385.

I do hope that you will join forces with the
Consortium to help parents and other adults communicate
with youngsters about a variety of issues like smoking
that are influenced in part by peer pressure.

My best wishes for a happy 1992.

Re: SALEM FULL FLAVOR Budget

Dear John:

I am enclosing the latest budget information for SALEM FULL
FLAVOR. Recap is as of September 5 and is based on:

a. August 25 revised budget information supplied by
Ms. B. R. Garner

b. Esty Media August 11 report issued to you earlier

0. Production spending in the light of management changes
to High Country, currently in progress

After inclusion of the mandatory $275M corporate reserve mini-
mum contingency, and $951M for spreads, the Brand has a nega—
tive net variance of $38M:

 

Net Budget Net Actual Diff.

FULL FLAVOR $12,515 $l2,553 (38)
16 MG. 12734 1,734 —~
Total: $1A,249M $14,287M (38)

The overage of $38M in total budget stems from a production
overage of $119M, only partially offset by an underage of
V$81M in space (See Exhibit 2).

The production average mainly results from:

a. Increased shoot and preparation costs previously dis—
cussed and reestimated, and additional work associated
with High Country currently in progress.

b. Inclusion of Black and Ethnic print not included in the
last report.

Dear Wyatt:

Ted, Gary, and I spent the day in Little Rock yesterday riding the
Rich Lights' showing and we were pl eased to find that, with one
exception, all the postings were in very good condition.

The one exception was a SO—sheet board posted at 7th and Park
which was flagging and was also obscured by a tree. Due to the
limited visibility, we recommend that that posting be moved to
a different location as opposed to simply correcting the flagging
problem.

There were also two locations that we could not find. One is
indicated on the map as a new location at U. S. 67 and 167 near
the l ittle Rock Air Force Base, and the other was indicated on
the .map at the Junction of U. S. 70 and 130. The onlx 30— —lS1eet
locations near the latter point were Bordon and Camel Lights.
Could you please advise the status of these two locations.

Finally, we saw a VICEROY parent 30—sheet location located

inbound on Highway 167 one mile west of the Pixie exit which was
virtually falling apart (the physical structure and the paper). The
structure had Baird on it, not Donrey. The location is very good;

however, we should not be paying for it due to its condition. We

would like to have the board completely stripped since its advertising
value is worthless and, in its present condition, is prObably detrimental.
Could you please check this out for us.

7 Wyatt, our net impression is that, given that the Little Rock plant
- A. is pretty average to start with, Rich Lights now looks better, as '__
' far as posting conditions go than any other showing in the market

RE: April 13, 1983 Request for Comment on
Possible Modifications in Cigarette
Testing Program ' '

_______________________________________________

Dear Ms. Crawford:

Enclosed are the responses of R. J. Reynolds
Tobacco Company as requested by the Commission on
April 13, 1983. We appreciate this opportunity to
comment.

We urge as a first priority that the Commission
immediately adopt a modification in methodology to
adjust for the new variablelintroduced~into~cigarette
"tar" and nicotine testing by "Barclay-type" or
"bypass" filters. The Commission's inquiry into
"bypass" filters has lasted long enough. It is time
for.action and results.

R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company has not yet
finalized its position on Question 7, which raises
broad questions concerning "smoker compensation." In
passing, however, two points should be made on this
subject. First, no two smokers will smoke cigarettes
in the same manner. In fact, the same smoker will
rarely smoke any two cigarettes in the same manner.
Therefore, as the Commission itself has frequently
noted, it is impossible to replicate human smoking in
all its varieties. For the Commission to allow
further delay in adjusting its methodology for "by-
pass" filters while it attempts to resolve the myriad
questions related to "compensation" and human smoking
would be unthinkable.

MEMO TO: Distribution

SUBJECT: FTC DocumehtRequest/Document Retention

The Federal Trade Commission’s Bureau of Competition has notiﬁed RJR that it is
conducting a “non-public investigation“ to determine if RJR is engaging in unfair methods of

competition or unfair practices by entering into agreements with retailers to maintain the prices
of cigarettes. . .

As part of the FTC' s notiﬁcation of the existence of this inquiry. the FTC has requested

RJR to produce a number of types of documents that are described herein below and to
preserve these types of documents. * -

The purpose of this memo is to informycu of the existence of the FTC‘s Investigation
and to alert you to the requirement that we suspend our normal document retention programs
as to any documents created since January 1.‘ 1993 that may be reasonably considered to be
covered by the FTC's document request about any “price related programs". The FTC has

RJR Interoffice Memorandum

SUBJECT: LDPE Flavor Beads DATE: January 22, 1986

T0: Mr. Brad Hoss FROM: Mr. Barry Saintsing

The materials we discussed in our meeting 1/16/86 have been received.
The information on the flavor loading in the LDPE is as follows:

0 Naarden — contains a 252 flavor load.
0 Firmenich - contains a 502 flavor load.
0 IFF - no percentage of flavor was given. They suggested

running a 52 and 102 by weight of the flavored LDPE
material.

Because all samples have different flavor loading levels, we will have

to use our best judgment for acquiring similar flavor levels on the
finished product.

If you have questions or we can be of any assistance for the Pilot
Plant run, please let me know.

MEMO T0: Mr. Richard Morgan
Director, Quality Assurance

SUBJECT: Lamina Particle Size

We've had several questions about why we're looking for increased particle
size in stemming and there has been some work done to illustrate that larger

particle size improves filling power. ‘

My position has been that we're looking for a cleaner product in pneumatic
separation to reduce stem particle "choke ups" in high speed machinery and
that we're reducing the smaller scrap level of particle size which gener-
ally equates to product waste in the end. From this. if we achieve a higher
filling capacity with larger particle size, that's a bonus feature.

Anyway, this discussion with our Research people in Canada produced some
good discussions. 1 g

INTEROFFICE MEMORANDUM

To: Doug Young FROM: Jennifer Bailey

RE: Web Gathered Cigarette Technology DATE: August 12, 1992

As I mentioned to you earlier, I am very interested in the web
gathered cigarette technology as a means to improve cigarette
quality. AKeas of interest include the following:

Improved cigarette rod uniformity

Enhanced consistency ,

Elimination of loose ends

Elimination of stem holes

Incorporation of additives such as calcium carbonate to
control burn rate & ash formation

Flavor addition

00000

0

However, I realize this technology is in its exploratory
stages of development and requires additional testing and
refinements before we can consider it as a replacement for out
filler.

As an interim step, I propose that we consider combining the web
gathered cigarette technology with conventional cut filler/
cigarette-making capabilities. If we can feed the tobacco web
into the center of the cigarette maker (Jim Pryor’s web funnel
guide) and feed the cut filler to the periphery, we may be able
to obtain some of the benefits of the web gathered cigarette
technology sooner than originally projected.

In essence, this approach could provide incremental improvements
to our current products while minimizing the risks associated
with a wholesale change.

I look forward to discussing this approach with the team at the
next meeting and appreciate your interest and support.

Jennifer Bailey

that challenge the de facto acceptance of this type of arson by showing people that this . . -
behavior has serious consequences and should not be accepted. I also think a smoke detector
component is appropriate.

RJRT INTEROPFICE MEMORANDUM

Subject: Freon 123/Freon 11 Date: April 10, 1990
Residue Decay

Study in Packaged
Cigarettes

To: Michael F. Borgerding Prom: Rhenda H.'Stee1e

At RJRT, once tobacco is expanded, this tobacco can be used to
make cigarettes in approximately two to six hours. Once
cigarettes are made, the cigarettes can be in the consumer's hand
in as little as three to four weeks, although the industry
average is three to four months. With these times in mind, the

following sampling points have been chosen for the packaged
cigarette residue decay study:

Day 0 (remove cigarettes from freezer)
Day 1

Day 4

Day 7 (1 week)

Day 14

Day 21

Day 28 (1 month)
Day 42

Day 56 (2 months)
Day 70

Day 84 (3 months).

These data are needed in order to estimate smoker exposure to
Freon 123 by the August decision date. It is understood that
this study will probably need to be repeated once PT&D optimizes
the Freon 123 expansion process in order to obtain a more
accurate curve for consumer exposure assessment.

Dear Dr. McAllister

I am writing this letter to inquire about the possibility of a phase out fund for the (HR
grant 2003 about the puriﬁcation of the adipogenic factor. I am aware that the renewal of
this application was not funded. However. since the submission of the proposal. we have
made considerable progress towards the complete puriﬁcation of the hepatocyte-derived
adipogenic factor. If we could obtain a phase out fund of 15,000 dollars, this will allow
me to continue supporting for 5 months the visiting scientist from Japan who has been
carrying out this project. This will give him the opportunity to complete the very
difﬁcult but very important puriﬁcation of the adipogenic factor for which he has worked
so hard. Unfortunately, the Cell Science Center is going through a ﬁnancially very
difﬁcult time so that people that would be otherwise supported in the interim by the
institutional fund do not have this opportunity anymore. This will also allow us to obtain
additional data so that we can write application to support the whole project I am aware
that this is a very exceptional request but because of the long standing interest of the
Council for innovative research. I am hopeful that this request will be favorably
evaluated. I will be very happy to provide you with additional data on the progress of the
puriﬁcation of the adipogenic factor if you need them.

1 would like to thank you for your kind consideration in this matter.

Dear Mr. White,.

Re: Your study on Passive Smoke

_ New England Journal of Medicine.
It is indeed heartening that at long last scientific evidence is

\available to show the harmful effects of passive smoke on non smokers.

We have done research on less harmful effects of cigarettes for
the non smoker and the smoker himself for over 20 years. The results
of our research have produced a number of patents which have a major
effect of reducing the sidestresm smoke to almost zero, thus removing
the very dangers to the lungs of the non smoker. ‘ - ‘ _; 5“

You.have stated ”I think the protection of human health is very
important. I'm one who really detests legislation, but I wouldn‘t
have any idea how to protect non smokers without some type of
legislation". We have this answer.

Our developments in this area are based on coating the cigarette
paperwith a well known, safe compound which has been documented over
the years to be clear, tasteless, odorless, inert, non carcinogenic
and non allergenic, releasing only a small amount of water vapor into
the smoke stream. » ‘ . '

The applied compound forms an insulating cover over the burning‘
coal which, in turn, slows the burning rate of the cigarette between

puffs, without interfering with the quantity, quality and taste of the
puff. -

The state of California has tested our cigarette development for
its properties of fire resistance. Enclosed is a copy of their report.

The Department of Health, Education and Welfare tested an earlier
version of our cigarette development with test results showing about
20% less ”tars", nicotine and carbon monoxide in the mainstream smoke
and about 60% less ”tars", nicotine and certain gases in the sidestream
smoke. See enclosed results of their report.

 

The legislative needs should rnthcr be directed townrd cirrhottos

for this space is $34 per s/f. Our lease expires on December 31, 2004. We have an
option to terminate the lease without penalty on May 31, 2001.

I have attached a lease buyout proposal for our Washington oﬂice space. This
proposal provides that we will be released from our lease obligations if we make a
lump sum settlement payment of $575,790 and continue our lease payments through
October 31, 1999. If our landlord ﬁnds a tenant who needs access to the space
before October 31, 1999, TI will vacate the space early and its rent obligation will be
reduced accordingly.

REDACTED

I recommend that The Institute’s member companies accept this offer.

I would like you to present this proposal to the T1 member company group that has
been dealing with Institute close-down issues.

Sincerely,

William A. Adams

Re: 1985 Performance Plan Summary

In order to assist me with preparation of the 1985
Performance Plan Summary, please prepare a list in short concise
statements of your accomplishments during 1985. A few examples

are shown below:

*

An environmental smoke test chamber with appropriate
control of temperature, humidity, air flows, lighting, and
air leakage has been successfully constructed and is in

operation.

Studies of environmental smoke with various analytical
methods and instrumentation have clearly demonstrated that
the nicotine is found in the vapor phase of the aerosol.

An innovative UV absorption method has been developed to
measure the levels of HTS collected on chamber surfaces.

Denuder tube technology has been developed to aid in the
understanding of vapor—particulate partitioning in ETS.

An improved mass spectral search library specific for
sidestream bases has been developed.

Re: Grant No. 4264Rl
Dear Dr. Templeton:

The Council for Tobacco Research - U.S.A., Inc. (CTR), is pleased to award you a renewal
grant in the amount of $80,000, including indirect costs, for the period from January 1, 1997
through December 31, 1997 for the proposed study: "Regulation of Cell Stress Signaling by a
New Antioxidant Protein." It is understood that this grant is made subject to acceptance by
institutional authorities. Also, many applications to CTR indicate partial or complete overlap
with submissions to other agencies. If the latter result in awards, we should be notiﬁed
promptly so that we can negotiate an appropriate adjustment of our award.

The award is made without guarantee of support beyond December 31, 1997, even though
we recognize that your original application proposed a study extending one year beyond that
date. Therefore, if by May 31, 1997, you submit to us a formal non-competing renewal
application, including a report of your progress, your request will receive consideration,

Please review the enclosed "Important Procedural Information for Grantees." Please ﬁll in
the attached "Notice of Research Project" and return it to me, Contact Drs. Harmon McAllister
or George Hashim of our scientiﬁc staff on matters concerning your grant and keep us informed
about the progress of your study.

The enclosed statement of “Financial Requirements” indicates that the Council recovers
unexpended annual balances over $1,000 and that year end deﬁcits cannot be recovered from
CTR, even from funds awarded in a subsequent year. Moreover, our failure to receive timely
ﬁnancial statements from your grants ofﬁce will stop further payments. Appropriate forms will
be sent to your ﬁnancial ofﬁcer at the end of the grant year. Administrative problems are
relatively rare and we hope that this will obviate any possible misunderstandings.

Dear Dr. Jameson:

I understand that the National Toxicology Program is accepting comments for use in its
consideration of a petition to list environmental tobacco smoke (“ETS”) as a “known human
carcinogen" or as being “reasonably anticipated to be a known human carcinogen.” Scientists at
R. J. Reynolds are gathering pertinent infomation that we believe will assist NTP in its
determination. That information will be forwarded to you shortly by them.

In the meantime, as you may know, a federal district court recently vacated the 1992
Environmental Protection Agency’s Report on Environmental Tobacco Smoke that sought to
classify ETS as a known human carcinogen. I enclose a copy of the court's opinion for your
review and consideration as the NTP considers listing ETS.

The opinion begins by discussing the procejdkillres Congress had established for EPA to follow in
its research program on indoor air quality. e court concluded that EPA fell short of complying
with those procedures. The court then, however, reviewed the record to determine whether,
“aside from procedural defects" (page 38), EPA conducted the risk assessment in accordance
with the Radon Research-Act. . The‘core scientiﬁc requirements of the Radon Research Act are

identiﬁed as “ g]athering all relevant information, researching, and disseminating ﬁndings"

(page 90) and providing "clear, objective 1 formation about indoor air quality" (page 91). The '
lr°

court found that EPA' 5 goal was to name E
objective scientific review.

S a Group A carcinogen, rather than to conduct an

Thank you for your interest in our program of research support. In response to

your request, I am pleased to enclose a copy of the explanatory materials sent by L
ﬂThe Council for Tobacco Research to potential principal investigators who have

inquired about support for their research projects. Those materials detail our two

step application process. The executive committee of our Scientific Advisory

Board first evaluates a Preliminary Application and decides whether or not to

encourage submission of a Full Application.

Their decision is based not only on scientific merit, but also on appropriateness for
inclusion in one of the Council’s multidisciplinary program areas, as well as
recognition of current support levels for similar projects. This procedure takes
about two months.

’ In order that your office has on hand a reference set of our Full Application
forms, a sample copy is enclosed. You "will also find in this package our Statement
of Policy, Information for Applicants and a recent Annual Report that lists
currently supported grants and contains abstracts of papers that have appeared over
the last year acknowledging support from The Council for Tobacco Research.

Before we‘can approve a travel allocation for

In general it is not the policy of The Council to encourage

conferences or some particularly needed visit to some
laboratories. I am quite sure that no special allocation would
be made for this purpose. If it can be done with the support—

Dear Friend of Carrie Meek:

Plans are continuing to shape up for the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation' 3 23rd

Annual Legislative Weekend, September 15 19, at the Washington (D. C.) Convention Center.
For your consideration I‘ve enclosed a preliminary schedule of events and associated costs
There 15 not a registration fee for the CBC weekend ISEuo Forum and Braintrusts, however,

registration is required.

Issue Forums are scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday at the Washington Convention
Center. The Braintrusts will be held on Friday in committee rooms on Capitol Hill.

Fashion show, two shows, Friday, 8 p.m., and Sanmiay 12 noon. This year‘s theme:
A Return to OZ. After Friday’s fashion show there will be a beneﬁt concert featuring either
Chaka Kahn or Gladys Knight.

The keynote speaker fur Saturday rlight' 5 awards dinner has yet to be decided. Bernard

Show of CNN will serve as the Master of Ceremonies and entertainment will be provided by
the O'Jays and lover-t.

I realize that attending the CBC weekend is quite an expensive proposition considering
airfare and housing cons. However, I would like to encourage as many of you who can afford
to attend to do so. The Braintrust and the Issues Forums are usually very thought provoking.
The social events are usually very nice, but trying to attend all of them could cost you an arm
and a leg. So use your own judgment.

On Friday evening Congresswoman Meek will host a complimentary reception on the
roof top terrace of the Madison Building of the Library of Congress for her friends from Miami.

Discussion: '

o The NFO test results from the prototype tests, FT—3775-C & D, were .
presented and compared to the January In—Market and the October Marlboro
results. A significant improvement in perfromance was realized only

among the 18—24 year old male competitive smokers. The team was advised

that Marketing has recommended a change in the primary action standard
from 25-34 males to 18—34 males. Among the 18—34 male competitive

smokers, both prototypes represent parity products. Marketing is recom-
mending introduction of prototype C. %”7+ and attribute ratings are
attached for both franchise and competitive smokers.

o Attribute ratings from the last four NFO In-Market tests on WINSTON KS.
going back to the first 1982 Competitive Product Test, were reviewed
and compared to 3518-A and 3518-8. 7+ and attribute data are attached.

WINSTON KS "A“ cut filler was ordered from Manufacturing.
Cigarettes were made and packed in the R&D Plant .

that scored a 59 on NFO. Product was b1ended, made.

and packed in the R&D Plant.

 

FT-3518-A:

One common factor among all the low scoring (49-53) WINSTON products

Dear Hudnall: \é§*S)\L

The Monograph on the new cigarette was here on my desk
when I returned to New York, and I really have enjoyed reading
this. Needless to say, I did not absorb every nuance, but the
overall impact of the document is very positive.

First of all, I am impressed with the meticulous nature
of your studies and the exemplary way in which they are
presented. Obviously your peer review committee felt the same

way.

Next, the product of itself is impressive. I was
astonished when I saw it "in action" at our meeting with you,
and now the analysis of the concept and the construction is
equally impressive.

Finally, you have done a very good thing in producing
this document. It should help the new product gain public as
well as scientific acceptance. There would seem to be little
doubt that you are on the right track.

When I have absorbed a little more from the volume, I
will pass it around the office so that all can see this.

I am enclosing a summary of the neuroendocrine effects

of nicotine, prepared by Dr. Don Ford of our staff here at CTR.

Don is a neuroanatomist, who has a long-standing interest in
nicotine effects, and he has prepared an excellent summary
which might be of interest to Bob DiMarco or some of the
members of his staff.

Thanks for the welcome on our recent visit and thanks
for letting me see the book.

MR. HUGH BROOKS

RE: PETERSON PUBLISHING

Dear Hugh:

AS you know, Peterson Publishing has come to us with a proposal
regarding back covers in Motor Trend.

We withdrew from Motor Trend about a month ago. The reason for
BROWN & WILLIAMSON's withdrawal from Motor Trend was that the
corporation had no back cover franchises. Related to our not
having back cover franchises, we felt that the publication‘s
back-up policy of requiring only one inside page for each back
cover may be to the detriment of BROWN & WILLIAMSON.

Motor Trend is the most efficient measured magazine for both
KOOL and VICEROY. If it were not for our dispute with the pub—
lication regarding back cover positions for B&W, we certainly
would not have withdrawn from the publication.

The publication has offered us one back cover in 1974 (July is-
sue). In addition, they have offered first option on another
back cover. The Representative (Mr. Dick Opfer) also has indica-
ted that he will try to secure more back covers. The July back
cover would be in trade for one of our existing inside covers.

At the time we exercise the option on the additional back cover,
it would be in trade for one of our existing inside covers. Un—
til we exercise that option, we do not have to give up the inside
covers.

 

_ 4%.»

Although this offer from Motor Trend does not address itself to
the publication‘s back—up policy, Mr. Opfer has indicated that

the back—up policy is due for further examination by Peterson
management. However, he feels it is quite unlikely that a change
in the back—up policy would be implemented in the very near future.

The net result of the various meetings with Peterson is that BROWN
& WILLIAMSON has gained one back cover franchise and a first option
on another back cover franchise. We believe it is reasonable to
seek a little more.

Dear Mr. Hoyt:

Dr. Kouri and Dr. Henry have had conversations with Dr. Lisanti
relative to the timetable we were following for the Final Report
and manuscript preparation on Contract 0030. I thought it would be
appropriate for me to drop you this note to let you know the current
status of our progress.

Over the Christmas holidays we ran into some serious computer

hardware problems which resulted in our falling behind schedule by
approximately one week. Then last week Dr. Kouri‘s best friend was
killed in an automobile accident, causing us to lose a week of his

input. Thus we are behind our original target by two weeks and,
therefore, I would like to revise the deadline for submission of

the Final Report to January Blst. Since the manuscripts are in
tandem and will be generated from the Final Report Data Base, the

completion date for the two manuscripts would be rescheduled to
March 3lst.

I hope this does not inconvenience you significantly, and
appreciate your understanding in the matter. I have seen the work
they are generating and feel certain that you will be quite pleased
and impressed with the Final Report.

Sincerely,

I am sure you are aware of the advortieoment placed in Monday's

you exteneively. Although, I am sure your remarks are quite

Whether or no there be a demonstrated causal relationship
between smoking and any disease, the statistical evidence
ie overwhelming that smoking is harmful. Any exwemoker will

aleo testify to a general improvement in his health upon
stopoing cooking.

I find that I dare not smoke a single cigarette lest I fell
victim once again to the habit. When I was a heavy smoker

(2% packs a day) i found I did enjoy a for cigarettes occasionally.
Moot cigaretteo I smoked however because of the habit

It would seem to me that the moat fruitful avenue for tobacco-
related research would be in the field of addictiou. If you
could identify the addicting agento and remove them from
tobacco smoke, you might make it poceiblc for a person like

me to enjoy an occasional cigarette without fear of addiction.

Dear Senator Magnnson:

As a past President of the Association of State and Territorial Health

Officers and the representative of that Association on the National Interagency
v Council on Smoking and Health, I have been designated by our Association to
write to you to express the opinion of our Association concerning S. 559 and

S. 547. These bills are concerned with federal requirements for cigarette
labeling and advertising and are before your Committee on Commerce for-
consideration.

At its 1964 annual meeting our Association, cornposecl of the health
officer of each state and each territory of the United States, passed a recom—
mendation to the effect that since cigarette smoking is a proven health hazard
the state health departments and the United States Public Health Service'need to
develop comprehensiye programs to help to bring under control the habit 'of
cigarette smokinn. A copy of the‘Association recommendation is attached.

f In View of the fact that our members unanimously agreed that scientific
"evidence shows that cigarettes are in truth a health hazard, we would like to been
record as supporting the type of federal legislation embodied in S. 559 or S. 547.
We feel that the major health hazards for which cigarette smoking is a causative
factor, such as cancer ofthe' lung, emphysema and chronic bronchitis, are so
important todaythat people .who smoke cigarettes, should be able to read on the -

labeling on the cigarette package the dangers to their health they are facing by
continual cigarette smoking. , ' A

‘We also feel that the Federal Trade Commission needs to have its
position clearly understood and strengthened as far as labeling and advertising

is concerned. Whether this needs specific wordin'g as to advertising as- in S. 547 '

or simply leaves the Federal Trade Commission free to propose and undertake

such advertising control as it'wishes under its existing authority is a matter about '

which we do not feel sufficiently knowledgeable to cmnuwnl‘ at this time; except
.‘n H.|\' Hm: the opinion of tho Federal 'l‘r:uh-- Commission rvgarding tho .‘-\d\'vrlv.tng

RE: Grant No. 2257
Dear Mr. Gertenbach: .

We were delighted to learn of the award of the above grant
to support our work on DNA ligase. I enclose a new budget and
other materials as requested. Although the award is for a lesser
amount than we requested and for one year, it will be an enormous
help in fulfilling our goals.

There is no overlap between the goals of this grant and that
awarded by the National Cancer Institute to Dr. John Chan which
will focus upon the molecular biological studies aimed at
analyzing the gene involved in this disease. The studies
supported by the Council under Grant No. 2257 will be focused
upon the enzymology of the human cells. The appointment of Dr.
Heahyun Yoo to this aspect of the project is to achieve that
specific purpose. Dr. Yoo, a research associate in my
laboratory, has an extensive background in enzymology as is
evident by her CV and bibliography (enclosed).

Once again we thank you for this generous award and assure
you of our efforts to guarantee its success.

'Re: Cigarette Marketing Standards Act (CMSA)
Dear Mr. Andree:

You have contacted us in regard to the legality of certain cigarette mannfacturers’ promotions
under the Cigarette Marketing Standards Act (CMSA). This letter is in response to that inquiry.

As you are aware, the Department issued TSB-M-OO (2)M on March 3, 2000 stating that
certain manufacturers’ promotional programs known as “buy-downs" and “master-type" programs
are prohibited under CMSA. Please reference that memorandum for details. It is the Department’s
view that any change with regard to “buy-downs" and “master-type” programs would require
statutory change by the Legislature.

Pursuant to longstanding interpretations of CMSA, the industry has offered other types of
promotional programs, including price reductions and trade discounts provided for on the
manufacturer's invoice and “buy one, get one free“ (or buy some, get some free) promotions. These
programs continue to be allowed under CMSA, provided (1) the trade discount or price reduction
(including any price reduction due to free product) is reflected on the manufacturer’s invoice; (2) all
cigarette tax agents selling the manufacturer’s brands in New—York State are allowed to participate
in the promotion; and (3) the promotion is not limited to speciﬁed retail dealers (other than for
purposes of proportional allocation of available supply of promotional product). The industry has
also offered manufacturer's coupons. These are allowable under CMSA, provided that the coupon
is either published in a newspaper or magazine of general circulation, or mailed directly to the
consumer by the manufacturer.

Dear Dr. Hashim:

 

Albany,~ New York. This will be the ﬁfteenth 1n the series of Albanyﬂnnferencesorgamzedbwhe

Nucleic Acid Technologies Foundation, in conjunction with several area academic and scientiﬁc
institutions.

As you can see from the enclosed ﬂyer for this year's meeting, the topic is a very timely one.
There has been a burst of interest in recent years on mitochondrial involvement in normal cell
function and in disease. Mitochondrial defects are being implicated in a host of neurological,
muscular and metabolic disorders (including diabetes) In addition, considerable interest is
starting to focus on mitochondria as targets for a wide range of drugs, including benzodiazepines,
immunosuppressants, channel blockers, and nucleoside analogs. Because of the renewed interest in
this "old" organelle, the meeting is attracting a distinguished group of front— line researchers to
present their latest work.

The reputation and visibility of the Albany Conference series have grown with each meeting over
the past 11 years. However, as with all ventures of this type, we rely heavily on outside sponsors
to help underwrite some of the expenses. Each year we have been fortunate to receive signiﬁcant
support from private organizations such as yours, who have a vested interest in promoting
biomedical research.

The Albany Conferences are unique in many ways, including their intimate nature and inter-
disciplinary focus. The audiences have been savvy and appreciative of the chance to exchange
ideas in the environment we provide. We make every effort to let them know which companies
have helped to make each meeting possible. '

This is a request that you consider helping us make the 1996 Albany Conference on Frontiers of
Mitochondrial Research a success with your sponsorship. We are seeking contributions in the
range of $500 to $5,000. Higher level contributions carry perks such as single-room
accommodations for scientiﬁc representatives (registration fee waived) and full-page sponsor
acknowledgements in the meeting program (design of your choosing but no product advertising).
Certainly, we would also be pleased to receive smaller contributions, all of which will be
recognized at the meeting and in the ﬁnal program.

Cigarette Excise Taxes

A House committee held a hearing on the Governor's proposal to increase the Magland
cigarette excise tax by $1.00 per pack (36¢-$1.36). A full committee vote on the measure
could be taken as early as March 5. Leadership of the House seems to be favoring an
increase of 50¢ per pack in 1999 and 50¢ more in 2000.

The New Hampshire Senate Ways and Means Committee passed legislation raising the
cigarette tax by 25¢ per pack (37¢-62¢). The full Senate is expected to give the bill a
second reading and refer it to the Senate Finance Committee. The Senate is expected to hold
the bill in the Finance Committee while the legislature debates other pieces of the education
funding legislation.

The 6O per pack (21¢-27¢) excise tax bill in New Mexico passed the Senate and has been
sent to the House. The Governor stated this week that he would veto any tax increase bill
that came across his desk.

In Wyoming, the bill that removes the sales tax exemption from tobacco products passed the
Senate.

MSA Le islation

The New Jersey Assembly Health Committee has scheduled hearings on two settlement-
related bills — one to set up a Tobacco Settlement Trust Fund and another to require non-
participating manufacturers to pay into a reserve fund.

A California Senate bill has been introduced to implement the "renegade" provisions of the
MSA. A total of 12 bills have been introduced in the legislature that direct where money
from the MSA might go, and four more bills were introduced to begin the battle over tax
revenues raised from Proposition 10, the 50¢ per pack ballot initiative that passed in
November.

Settlement related bills were also introduced in Connecticut and Vermont.

Dear Editorialist:

over the past few years, many state and local legislators
have been grappling with a new issue —- whether or not to
restrict smoking in many 'public' places.

The debate is often emotional. It revolves around issues
of health, management of private property, personal freedom
and law enforcement, to name a few.

The enclosed reprint, from our publication, LEGISLATIVE

subject.

To: J. H. Reynolds, III
Chairman, HRRC

From: T. A. Perfetti
Flavor Division, PA&T

Re: Calcium and Silicon Entrainment Data on Carbonized Cotton Linter
Sheet Material

The HRRC requested that calcium and silicon entrainment data be collected on
cigarette samples prepared with carbonized cotton linter sheet. The test
product, Sample G, contained 50% sheet material which had 60% by weight CaCO3.
(Sample G, see memo). Mr. R. T. White, Jr. has analyzed cigarettes with up to
30% total weight CaCO3 per cigarette (Samples A, B and F). Based on his anal—
ysis, calcium in the ash for Sample G was 63, 751 i 2985 ug/cigarette, i.e.
4.434 times the level of calcium in the control (WINSTON KS). The silicon in
the ash was 3122 g/cigarette for the test product (Sample G) and 3339 ug/
cigarette for WINSTON KS. Calcium entrained into the mainstream smoke for the
test product G was at a level equal to WINSTON KS (0.02 ug/cigarette) and

silicon entrainment into mainstream smoke was 0.042 ug/cigarette versus 0.066
pg silicon/cigarette for WINSTON KS.

The results indicate that the majority of the calcium, from the CaCO3 present
in the carbonized cotton linter sheet, resides in the cigarette ash >99%. The
amount of silicon in the ash is about equal to that found in WINSTON KS. The
amount of calcium and silicon entrainment for the test product G was no
greater than the control. All values for silicon were at or below the limit
of detection for mainstream smoke at 0.05 ug/cigarette.

As a result of these tests, we request permission for use of carbonized cotton
linter sheet material containing calcium carbonate in a blend of tobaccos of
up to a level of 30 weight percent calcium (see Sample G).

Dear Bill:

The perspective (and follow-up) afforded by a week seems
sufficient for reporting, though not finally, on the results of
our effort last Tuesday at the National Press Club and the
announcement of “Helping Youth Decide.“

The event was, as you know, preceded by a week- -long period of .;
'background briefings' with key media. The coverage based uponE;-'
these briefings, the event itself and follow-up fall into two 3 ’
broad categories. These are Print and Electronic.

 
 

0n the print side, we have verified the following:

The Lowell (Massachusetts) Sun ran the story. Copy to come.
The reporter was Tom Squitieri.

Gannett News Service -- serving 86 newspapers in 37 states --
ran the piece. The reporter was Pat Ordovensky.

Scripps-Howard -- serving over 60 newspapers out of the
Washington bureau -— filed the story. Ken Eskey is the
reporter. A copy of this one has already been forwarded to your
attention.

USA Today ran with the story on the day of the event. As you
know from my backtracking, the eventual three-line item which
appeared in the National News section that day was culled from a
larger, more comprehensive piece done for the Life section by
reporter Barbara zigli. The piece was deemed more national than
lifestyle news by the Life section editors and it was shipped to
National where it was snipped by Julia Wallace who is a national
news editor. No follow-up by USA Today is planned, although
Life editor Linda Kauss wants to see updates on program
acceptance, usage, etc.

Dear John,

Thanks for your letter. I have reviewed Tims report as well as
Pats latest progress noﬂZto me.you will find enclosed a copy of my advice
to Pat. I am very interested in knowing what antiserum Chick Turner used
for the CF test. We may need to use the anti-hamster leukemia virus serum
for all our testing. Positive results would be very provocative.

I am now in the process of arranging my charter flight to
California in November. I have obtained a ticket on a plane arriving
in San Francisco about November 10.

I had one idea which may make our meeting more convenient
for you and at the same time enable me to visit NIH to get some supplies
and finish up some paper writing there. Is it possible for CTR to pay my trip
from San Francisco to New York ? I would leave the ﬁbnday after the
conference (hbvember 15). We could spend one or two days together and . I
then I'll go down to Washington. I can get a charter flight from New
York to Paris very easily but must make a reservation very soon.

If you prefer meeting me in California, I shall reserve the
return flight from there, Await your reply.

Looking forward to talking with you.

Have lots to share with you.

Best regards.

To: The Members of the Management Committee

FROM! Samuel D. Chilcote, Jr. 553:0,

Enclosed for your review prior to our conference call November 16
are The Institute staff's recommendations for 1993 creative and
media buys for the “Tobacco: Helping Youth Say No" and "It's the
Law" print campaigns. These materials include a narrative
describing the rationale for the proposed insertion schedule, the
new creative work, and the budget. As with all program
materials, our audience is adults. By way of summary:

 

"Tobacco: Helping Youth Say No"

Three different creative concepts are included in the 1993
"Tobacco: Helping Youth Say No" print advertising package
(Tab 1).

The first, "It's Tough Growing Up," complements the print
messages for 1991 and 1992, and continues to dovetail the themes
stressed by the television PSAs. This ad has been designed for
placement in general consumer books and minority publications, at
a budget totaling $694,000 for general consumer (down $256,000
from 1992) and $85,000 for minority media (down $10,000).

A second ad, "Smoking Should Not Be A Part of Growing Up," has
been designed for decision maker publications and continues to
promote both the youth and "It's the Law" components of the
industry's youth initiatives. The 1993 budget for decision maker
publications is at $291,000 (up $66,000 from 1992).

The third ad, also headlined "Smoking should Not Be A Part of
Growing Up," is designed for the education trade press and is the
same ad that began running midway through 1992. Because the
educator audience is the peer group of the Family COURSE
Consortium members, the Consortium is designated as the sponsor
of this ad, made possible by a grant from The Institute. This
sponsorship again dovetails the designation carried by the PSAs.
A full-year schedule for the education press is budgeted at
$25,000 (a $5,000 increase).

(TOBACCO DOES NOT CAUSE LUNG CANCER )

This headline would create quite a sensation. Millions of folks who have
begn fgightened by the publicity, stopped smoking, which they thoroughly
en oye .

I am sure you will agree that they are justified in doing so, because no
one would keep doing something that so many Doctor's and research men haVe
agreed and disagreed on as the use of Tobacco and the possibility of cont-
racting lung cancer.

While watching a recent Television program, I saw how they had painted the
backs of mice with the tar which had been extracted from smoke of a battery
of cigarette machines. This tar apparently was so strong an irritant that
it destroyed the hair, and after repeatedly being painted on-the skin of
the mousesgback, eventually did develop a cancerous condition. There must
be many other substances you could use on the mouse and createrthe same-

condition much quicker.
I have read of the research that has~been done with human like action:of’the:

cigarette smoking machines, the function of the filter, nicotine comparison

with and without filters etc.
Is it pessible that some smokers are contracting Lung Cancer.from sulphur

irritation?

My theory isathis. ‘

a- Pipe smokers who use long matches, always waitifor the match to get a
good flame;before holding it‘to the bowl of the pipe. Thereby the fumes:
of the2sulphur flame:have been disapated in the air.

b- A'cigar smoker follows the same proceedure as the pipe smoker.

c- A Cigarette smoker gets a quick light, right off of the sulphur flame.
Cigarette smokersehave universally formed a habit of cupping the flame
of the match, whether it istor there own light or.in offering to light
the cigarette of arfriend.

This.proceedure‘ has happened many thousandsﬁof times<in my presents'in
the past thirty five yearstthat Ilhave smoked cigarettes, however the

other day while playing golf IZwas offered a light by one of the' foursome‘

who also had the habit of cupping his handszto protect the-flame which

of "starbursts" on the SALEM Long Lights low pro-
file riser card. The Brand Group recommends that
"starbursts" not be used along with the SALEM

Long Lights low profile riser card. This action
has been taken due to legal restrictions relating
to live advertising space on the POS item. Fi-
nally; it is understood that you will communicate

’ Dear Ray:

One of my colleagues at the American Cancer Society sent me
the Report of the Council for Tobacco Research—U.S.A., Inc., 1992.
You are listed there as being an American Cancer Society Professor
of Cellular and Developmental Biology and that is mentioned again.
in the introduction (see enclosed). While the Society is very
grateful for your using your American Cancer Society title in
publications and public appearances and the like, it is not.'
appropriate, it seems to us, to have it listed with the Council for
Tobacco Research. For our staff and volunteers this is a conflict
of interest—-that at least is the perception. These are the people
that bring us products that kill a half million Americans a year,
and for the American Cancer Society to be in any way associated
with the Council for Tobacco Research lends 1t credibility that is

frangly embarrassing.

\
x

We certainly recognize that the members of the Scientific
Advisory Board are a distinguished group of people who are making
sincere efforts on behalf of research. Please don't take this

, request personally, but I hope you understand the sensitivity that‘
We have to this issue of tobacco and cancer. They are not very

broad minded when it comes to dealing with some investigators that

are funded by the American Cancer Society who prOVide information
which they don’t like-—in fact, the tobacco companies have severely
pressured several scientists-funded by the Society.

I wish you continued success and look forward to seeing you at
the Professors' meeting. With all best wishes.

Sincerely,

Re: Grant No. 1991
Dear Dr. Cohen:

 

The Council for Tobacco Research, USA, Inc. is pleased to offer you a new grant in the
amount of $80,000.00 for the period from January 1, 1987 to December 31, 1987 for the study
proposed in your application dated June 1, 1986. It is understood that this grant is made
subject to acceptance by institutional authorities as heretofore. We recognize that this
appropriation is somewhat less than you requested, but hope it will suffice to maintain your
study at a productive level. If you wish to accept it, please notify us accordingly and submit a
revised budget to show how the available funds will be distributed. A new budget sheet is
enclosed for this purpose.

The award is made without guarantee of support beyond December 31, 1987, even
though we recognize that your application proposes a study extending beyond that date.
Therefore, if by May 31, 1987 you submit to us a formal renewal application, including a
report of your progress to date, your request will receive consideration in competition for
available funds. 3

Your attention is called to the enclosed "Important Procedural Information for
Grantees". Please fill in the attached "Notice of Research Project" and return it to me. Drs.
Harmon McAllister, Research Director, and David Stone, Associate Research Director, will
serve as your primary contact with our scientific staff on matters concerning your grant.
Please consult them as questions or problems arise, and keep us informed about the progress of
your study.

. AS Principal Investigator, you should know that CTR recovers unexpended balances at
the end of each grant year. We suggest that you personally keep an accurate record of
expenditures and commitments to assure that you agree with your institution‘s official financial
statement at the end of the grant year. Please note that year-end deficits cannot be recovered
from CTR, even from funds awarded in a subsequent year. Finally, please be aware that our
failure to receive timely annual financial statements from your grants office will stop further
grant payments. Appropriate forms will be sent to your financial officer at the end of the
grant year. Administrative problems are relatively rare and we hope that this statement of our
fiscal policies will obviate any possible misunderstandings.

Cordially,

Pk haw»

Dear Honorable Bilirakis:

The California Beverage Merchants Association, representing over 3,000 mom
and pop liquor and convenience store owners in California, has been pleased to
promote the We Card program to it’s members for over a year. We have
publicized the program through our newsletters, distributed materials in our
membership kits, and championed the We Card Kits at membership meetings.

We believe that this program is an important tool for our members to use in

training their staff in responsible retailing, and have had very positive feedback
from them.

As a member of the Coalition for Responsible Tobacco Retailing, we have
helped to set up and promote training for members and non-members alike,

including planning an aggressive program of training for California retailers in
April, May and June of this year.

We Card has significantly helped our members and their employees in lowering
the incidents of sales to minors, and we are pleased to be a part of this important

effort.

Sincerely,

Dear Ms. Giachino:

Thank you for your May 10, 2000 letter to William S. Ohlemeyer.
Because of my past involvement in the Engle litigation, your letter
has been referred to me for response.

For a variety of reasons and on a variety of grounds, Philip Morris
Incorporated argued strenuously and repeatedly in Engle against
the discovery of any information regarding Philip Morris
lncorporated’s consumer lists. Despite Philip Morris
lncorporated’s and other defendant's objections, the Date County
Judge presiding in Engle ordered that certain consumer list
information be provided to class counsel.

In light of the court’s ruling, counsel for Philip Morris Incorporated
then took steps intended to maintain the confidentiality interest of
Philip Morris Incorporated and its consumers including:

In response to your question concerning the PM Blues analysis, the fol-

. The 10% processed stems level in PM Blues is
higher than any other PM product analyzed.
PM stems are puffed all flue—cured stems.

A normal PM product has 3-51.

' PM Blues also uses no dark 6-7, which is
produced on a steel belt, versus the light
sheet, which is produced on a felt belt.
All other PM products analyzed have both
light and dark reconstituted sheet.

_ An analysis of PM's Private Label brands were previously completed and
indicated the presence of light and dark reconstituted sheet. Also, there is

a low 1 of processed stems in the Private Label brands. _

If I can be of further assistance, please do not hesitate to call.

SUBJECT: FUTURE DEVELOPMENT: PRICE-CONSCIOUS AND
PRESTIGE CATEGORIES

 

The following white paper by Doug Weber discusses the future development of

the Price-Conscious and Prestige categories. This document is in response to
your request for a "think piece" on how these two categories might develop in

the next five years.

In the document three separate scenarios are discussed. Each scenario differs
in the amount of growth achieved by the Price-Conscious and Prestige
categories by 1988. These variations are supported by hypotheses regarding
industry competitive actions and reactions, marketing resource availability,
technical capabilities, and economic and social pressures facing cigarette

C0118 ume I'S o

Also included is a description of factors that may impact the likelihood of
each scenario and the future development of the market.

Finally, we have included specific recommendations for RJR. These
recommendations address the need to:

1. Prevent the occurrence of an RJR competitive disadvantage in the
Price-Conscious category. Specifically, we need to be prepared to

introduce new Price-Conscious brands, plot potential competitive
moves, and increase our intelligence activities to ensure ourselves

maximum lead-times.

2. Explore all possible opportunities and positions within the Prestige
category.

3. Place high priority on the development of products and other elements

of our marketing mix that will provide us superior brand propositions
and competitive advantages. This could be done through improved
technologies, more efficient distribution systems, and more effective
promotional tools.

» Dear Mr. McCall: _
Thank you for your letter of February 7, 1964.

4 Quite a few of our friends have suggested or offered to
disclose lines of research which might clarify the large gaps
in existing knowledge of the relation of tobacco to health.

we want you to know we appreciate the constructive approach
you and your client have adopted. However, we have thought it
best not ourselves to engage in the type of research your letter .
contemplates. Instead, since 1954 we have supported the Tobacco
Industry Research Committee, 150 East 42nd Street, New York 17,
New York, which has made grants totalling several million dollars
to independent scientists engaged in a coordinated program of
research into questions of tobacco use and health.

Dear Ray:

1
The R. J. Reynolds corporate schedule in Redbook magazine is now the
equivalent of 23 national page which qualifies all advertising for the
18 to 25 page discount. This discount is 17;; for advertising placed in
issues January through June and 19; for advertising, scheduled from July
through the end of this year.

It would be to the advantage of Reynolds to consider scheduling at least
one more page h-color insertion at a cost of $19,519 which would make all
advertising scheduled for this year eligible for the next discount level,_
21. to 30 Pages, thus earning a 2532’: discount and a rebate of $44,461 re-
sulting in a savings of $24,942. » ,

. To take advantage of this Opportunity Reynolds would have to schedule
the additional page insertion in either the November or December issues
since the closing date for October has passed. I'IIIISTCI‘I and VANTAGE are
both scheduled for the November and December issues thus SAll-i-i or DORAL

would have to be a - for the page insertion. SAL‘xﬁﬁ is presently

I. PUFFED TOBACCO

The study of puffing with volatile liquids. e.g., Freon-ll. near
ambient temperature has been continued tO'extend the useful range of
operating conditions. The process had produced a 230% increase in cross-
sectional area of flue-cured stem sections previously. The concentration
of Freon-ll vapor in the atmosphere-used to treat the stem sections has
been estimated to be 5.4 mg./ml. by MS. An attempt to estimate the
quantity of Freon-ll absorbed by the stem sections continues.

The stem section method has been applied to puffing with aqueous 002.

Preliminary data (see table) establish the system as a possible basis for
a puffing process. - _ '

Dear Mr. Eschwege:

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has reviewed
the General Accounting Office (GAO) draft report entitled
”Regulations of Cancer-Causing Food Additives —— Is It Time

for a Change?“

The report discusses the Delaney Clause of the 1958
Food Additives Amendment to the Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act, which directs the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) to ban the use of cancer—causing food additives.
According to the draft report, food safety experts believe
the Delaney Clause should be changed because of its
inflexibility; however, they disagree on alternative
regulations to the present statute.

The GAO report also points out that the requirements
of the Delaney Clause are inconsistent with the statutes
mandating the approaches used by EPA, the Consumer Product
Safety Commission (CPSC) and the Occupational Safety and
Health Administration (OSHA). For this reason and also
because of advances in scientific methodology, uncertainties
about the human risks from low-level carcinogens and the
inflexibility that exists under the Delaney Clause, GAO
recommends that Congress reexamine the Delaney Clause.

“EPA concurs with the general findings and conclusions
that GAO has reached in its analysis. EPA also concurs that
these findings provide a sound basis for GAO's recommendation
that Congress reexamine the Delaney Clause.

DRAFT LETTER TO RJRT OFFICERS

Date

Name
Address

Dear

I am sure you recognize the extent to which our future success depends

on decisions made by elected officials in Washington and the state capitals.
Anti—tobacco groups are intensifying their efforts to achieve a "smoke-free
society,“ and supporters of our industry in Congress and the state legis-
latures are finding it more difficult and politically costly to take a stand
on our behalf.

If we are to improve the legislative climate, R. J. Reynolds Tobacco must
dramatically increase its involvement in the political process. We must
continually ask elected officials for their support, and it is vital that we
be in a position to support them in return. As you know, the RJR Political
Action Committee is the best means available for our company to financially
support candidates who will consider our views intelligently and fairly.
However, for a variety of reasons, current PAC receipts are inadequate to

meet our increasing needs.

 

The RJR PAC deserves your most serious consideration and attention. Parti-
cipation in the PAC is voluntary, and no rewards or penalties are involved,
but any officer who is unwilling to make an investment in R. J. Reynolds
Tobacco’s future by supporting the PAC fails to recognize the importance of
the challenges we face in the political process.

Enclosed is a membership form and a return envelope for the RJR PAC. The

suggested contribution rate for the RJR PAC is .6% —- recognizing that
officers are also asked to contribute .4% to The Tobacco Institute PAC for a

total of 1% gross salary. Payroll withholding is, of course, the preferred
method of participation in the RJR PAC. A contribution form for TIPAC will
be sent to you after the first of the year.

I am confident that all RJRT officers will join me in supporting the PAC.
If you are already contributing, but at less than the suggested rate, I

encOurage you to consider increasing your level of support.

Sincerely,

Dear Dr. Gardner:

Following our discussion in New Haven, I reviewed my twin
populations born between 1897 and 1952. Our records show that there
were 7,859 pairs of like—sexed twins born in this period who sur-
vived to one year of age. Studies we have conducted in the past
would lead me to say that we should be able to locate approximately
60% or better of this population with both members alive and living

in Connecticut. This certainly is more than the minimum number of
pairs we discussed.

I have requested permission to attend the meeting in Miami
Beach the week of December 10 and have made reservations for arriv—
ing on the 9th. I hope you will make reservations for me. I anti-
cipate approval of my request and hope to see you shortly.

Sincerely yours,

Dear Dr. Mohr:

I enjoyed your recent visit to Winston-Salem and the discussions of your
results to date as well as discussions of mutually interesting research. I would
like to maintain some type of collaborative research effort even at this time
when our R&D department has severely limited ﬁnancial resources. I have
handed your proposal to Dr. Burger for examination and I understand he will
attempt to secure funding from sources outside of R & D. I also have included a
booklet concerning a request for applications of funding from CIAR (Center
for Indoor Air Research) which includes several R J Reynolds representatives
on the Board of Directors and on the list of Peer Reviewers. CIAR would look
with interest at an application concerning ETS exposure systems for in vitro
toxicology.

After reviewing your agreement with RJR, I noticed the termination
date was March 31, 1997. I have contacted our legal department to extend this
date to December 31, 1997 to allow adequate time and prevent a rush to utilize
the funds you have remaining. I have been very pleased with the results from
the cytotoxicity and micronuclei assays completed with the funds used to date
and look forward to initial results investigating the in Vitro smoke exposure
system with the remaining funds. I am hopeful that any results obtained with
HiQ using your in vitro smoke exposure system would beneﬁt our continued
collaboration on refining this promising technology for in Vitro smoke
exposure. Please let me know if I can provide any scientific expertise on the
exposure system or the cell cultures.

ENTER—OFFICE MEMORANDUM

T0: Dan R. Pugh
FROH: C. 0. Nays. 8. F. Niven

SUBJECT: R.A.N. Project Extraction Programs

Dr. H. Y. Rice and A. J. Sensabaugh have recently conducted a series of
experiments which resulted in cigarette smoke condensate displaying markedly
reduced biological activity. These experiments involved the application of
aqueous burley extract to flue-cured-tobacco and preparation of cigarettes
from the resultant treated flue-cured tobacco. Biological activity -was
determined through use of Ames tests.

Investigation and developmcit of this concept and a likely process for making
less biologically active yet flavorful Smoking products will include
aiditional experiments rsing various solvents and extraction practices.
' ant meetings with Dr. Rice cleared the way for us to begin extraction
. ,1ies of sizable samples. We are to extract, or to have extracted by
contracted means, at least three grades of burley tobaccos (must include KlOX)
and use the extract to enhance three grades cf flue-cured tobaccos. Smoke
condensate from resulting test cigarettes (burley extract enhanced flue-cured)
will be given to Dr. Rice for biological assay.

We also understand that perhaps some or all the test cigarettes should use
expanded tobacco. He have just written a preliminary disclosure of a process
invention covering the means for extract enhancement and filling value
increase of tobacco/tobacco flavored material. in all likelihood. development
and commercialization of this new process will require and justify design and
construction of a bench scale pilot plant to be located either here or at
Avoca.

We expect to begin extracting samples using conventional practices here this
month and we are hopeful that the patent disclosure memorandum will clear the
way for us to engage HUller Extract Company, GMBH for supercritical
extraction/expansion studies. These studies will both provide test material
for the RAN investic‘tisns and design knowledge to be needed for the likely
yflot plant program.

Work Proposal

Dr. A. H. Laurene Fronu Dr. Charles Rix

OBJECT: To sTudy means of flavoring TC devices To furTher augmenT The TasTe
of very low Tar (less Than 10 mg) clgareTTes.

New TC devices have many advanTages, The mosT obvious of which

is lessened Tar delivery. The air diluTion causes smaller amounTs of mainsTream
smoke To reach The consumer. PresenT TC cigareTTes have desirable flavor.
However, lf Tar levels were To conTinue To drop lower, perhaps To less Than

10 mg/cigareTTe, lessened flavor mighT resulT. lT is This possible reducTion

ln TasTe which makes The successful addiTion of flavoranTs To plasTic TC devices

desirable.

lNTRODUCTlON:

IT is suggesTed ThaT a sTudy of flavor Transfer from TC devices be
ianlaTed. The flavoranT would of necessiTy be held in a solid maTrix, eiTher
on an adsorbenT granule or in a permeable solid. The projecT would ascerfaln

The delivery properTies of model compounds such as menThol, nicoTine or
flavoranTs To The mainsTream smoke. [T would require The services of one 8.8.
chemisT for approximaTely 6 monThs. No new capiTal expendiTures for equipmenT

would be required.

Dear Dr. Sivak:

Enclosed find a copy of a protocol entitled 'Repeated Exposure Study with
Cigarette Smoke in the Rat”. We would appreciate receiving a cost estimate as
soon x possible. As Sam Simnons indicated to yea, we anticipate a
November 25, 1985 initiation date for this shady.

In addition to a cost estimate. our pathologist would appreciate receiving
a copy of several ADL SOP's. Gary Burger would like to see your SOP for lung
perfusion and your SOP for lung fixation and sectioning. Also, Dr. Burger
requires additional information regarding fixation and sectioning of nasal
sections. In particular, he is interested in your sop for decalcifications of
the nasal tnrbinates and the location from which the four sections are taken.
Please note on page 7 of the protocol the requirement for the presence of a
board-certified pathologist at all scheduled and mscheduled mcrvopsies.
Please confirm that ADI. can oonply with this.

If any questions arise regarding this protocol, feel free to call Sam

TO: C. D. McGee

FROM: Ms. Barbara Collie
Dr. J. H. Reynolds

DATE: September 18, 1991

SUBJECT: Prototype with Natural Chocolate Flavor #601442

Scientific Affairs understands you wish to conduct panel
testing on a full-flavor prototype (966C) using Natural Chocolate
Flavor #601442 from the Hagelin Company. The chocolate will be
used in the burley casing at a level of 0.29% of the total blend.
Approximately 30 panelists will be testing one prototype each which
has a WINSTON KS configuration with a 'tar' level of '16
mg/cigarette.

Scientific Affairs approves the use of this flavor for the
panel evaluation as described above. Since all ingredients are
currently in use by RJRT, you do not need to go to the HRRC prior
to going to panel. However, should this flavor be.further tested

in any other type of sensory evaluation or test market, Scientific
Affairs should be consulted. Additional review may be necessary,
based upon your proposed conditions of use.

Dear Dr. Silverman:

Thank 'you for your interest in our program Cf research support. I am pleased to enclose
our Statement of Policy, Information for Applicants and a recent Annual Report that lists
currently supported grants and contains abstracts of papers that have appeared over the
last year acknowledging support from The Council for Tobacco Research.

Our two-step application process is described on a separate enclosed sheet; it addresses
several topics including eligibility, funding levels, award duration and specific
instructions for submitting a Preliminary Application. Each application is reviewed by
members of our Scientific Advisory Board, a panel of established biomedical scientists
who serve as our peer review committee.

Briefly, applicants must be faculty level scientists having appointments at not-for-profit
institutions. The Council supports independent investigator-initiated projects (one, two
or three years) in a variety of biomedical research areas. In the event you receive an
award, annual, non-competing renewal applications are required and continued funding
is based on your progress and the materials you submit with the renewal request forms.

The Council encourages proposals from younger researchers, but as you will see from the
Annual Report, a number of our awardees are established scientists. We ask that you
complete the enclosed "Current and Pending Support" form since some consideration is
given to your current funding level. Complete scientific freedom is assured and ouronly
expectation is publication of research results in appropriate peer-reviewed journals.

110 East Fifty-Ninth Street

New York, New York 10022

Dear John:

I would like to indicate for you some of my thoughts on the current
Walton-Morrissey Smoking Machine, demonstrated at the March 9 meeting.

It is obvious that considerable thought and effort has gone into
bringing the machine to its present state of development. From a
mechanical viewpoint the design is simple, straightforward, and should
require minimum maintenance. There are several design features I
would like to comment on, some of which were discussed at the meeting.

The design of the inhalation chamber is such that smoke distribution
within the chamber is a function of the smoke entrance velocity and
the dilution air stream. Since the entrance velocity is constant, as
the dilution air is decreased, the effective distribution must, there-
fore, decrease. After the two second puff is terminated, the smoke
begins to age for an interval equal to the exposure time. Due to the
chamber design it also begins to settle to the bottom of the chamber
where the concentration is increased. Dr. Rosenkrantz commented that
animals in the lower area always expire first. Only a long term study
would establish a definite pattern.

During the meeting, attention was brought to the close proximity of
the cigarettes to each other. Dr. Rosenkrantz was to determine if the
free burn rate is changed due to radiant heat. The current holder
design is based upon the use of 45 mm diameter Cambridge pads which
restricts the spacing of the cigarettes. As I pointed out to you at
the time, 70 mm dia. Cambridge pads are available which would permit
the cigarettes to be moved further apart.

A final point in question is the capillary entrance port. This design
creates a potential for two physical changes to occur to the smoke

aerosol. As the smoke is compressed into the small diameter tunnel,
the chance for collision between particles is increased. If the

SUBJEcr: Funding For Air Purification Device
Development. Prototype Construction.
and Testing

Assisting in the Environmental Tobacco Smoke (31‘s) investigation for
mndamental Research and Development Department at Bowman Gray Technical
Center (BCTC). we have designed subject device. Development and testing of
this device has the potential of reducing the impact of ”31's" in public
buildings particularly food service and entertainment establishments.

We are requesting a grant of $4500 to accomplish subject work. To the best of
our knowlewdge at this time these funds will cover the cost of engineering.
materials and labor required to fabricate a prototype and testing to develop
effectiveness data for this device.

Legal council at BGIC is presently investigating patentability of subject
device. A decision should be reached by mid November on this matter.

If this funding is granted and we are advised to proceed with this work the
prototype can be constructed and ready for testing by January 1. 1988.

Please advise as to how we can further assist you in this matter.

SUBJECT: MODIFICATION TO ADD A FAS UNIT TO A PROTOS 80 MAKER
MAKING AND PACKING DEPT, BUILDING 601-1, WHITAKER PARK
FTC/PTO #00424R8

Dear Mr. Abrams:

Thank you for advising the Department of your plans to add a FAS unit to one of the makers
which allows the addition of natural menthol, at the maker, instead of the standard process of
adding menthol to tobacco product in the top dressing drums in the Casing and Cutting
Department at Tobaccoville.

As presented in your August 5, 1997 letter, the Department approves the installation and
operation of a FAS unit at Building 601-], Whitaker Park. RJRT may proceed with the
installation and operation of the FAS unit as permitting is not triggered by this modiﬁcation.

For this modiﬁcation, the Department accepts the assumption VOC emissions by direct
application of natural menthol at a maker will not signiﬁcantly affect the current emission factor
used for this process. However, in the future, should additional FAS units be planned, including
menthol application to other brands, we would request certiﬁcation of VOC emissions by use of
appropriate data which may include emissions stack testing. This certiﬁcation would then be
used to validate the assumption of no increase to VOC emissions by addition of natural menthol

(F AS unit) at a maker in lieu of processing Tobaccoville Casing and Cutting mentholated
product.

SUBJECT: Honda Motorgcie giveaway

American Honda has donated a 1995 60000 F3 production bike to RJR for
promotional opportunities. The plan is to paint it similar to the race bike. Honda
is extremely interested in displaying/marketing this bike at other Smokin' Joe
racing series’. They already impact the motorcycle industry.

Per our conversation. Marty. we could utilize this bike within direct mail pieces
for the Joe’s VIP club members buy notifying them of the sweepstakes.

Additionally, Mike, you said there Is a possibility we could incorporate the bike in
the NASCAR and NHRA MAU's. It would be a great tool to partner all SJR
entities and generate new names with a sweepstakes. These two plans would
greatly satisfy Hondas reasons for donating the bike. '

I know this crosses the lines of job responsibilities. Joe’s VIP Club and MAU
activities, however, we have an opportunity.

Currently the agency is developing the new SJR graphics on the reshaped
bodywork of the 600cc F3. i will advise both of you on the status.

Dear Store Manager:

For the past year, R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company has been actively seeking
support from the retail community in its fight to reduce underage smoking.
Since August of 1992, RJR has sent materials (literature as well as in-store
signage) on its youth non-smoking program, "Support The Law...It Works," to
over 20,000 retail outlets across the country. Over half of these stores have
requested additional material and information about the program.

In addition, R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company has had the privilege of having
Mr. Danny Glover, actor and parent, visit several cities, including New
Orleans, and speak to retailers about the importance of supporting this
age-restriction program.

It is my understanding that you may not be aware of this program so I am
sending a brochure that will provide you with pertinent information and what
materials are available. If you are already participating in the "Support The
Law" program, or something similar, thank you for your involvement. If you
are not participating in this program and would like to know more about it,
please review the brochure and send in for additional material using the
attached business reply card. All materials are available free of charge.

Thank you for helping us keep cigarettes out of the hands of kids. Remember,
when we all support the law...it works!

product from the market of various ages and have them analyzed
for the following components.

 

Ammonia in tobacco
Ammonia in smoke
Sugar in tobacco
Formaldehyde in smoke
Acrolein in smoke
Pyrazines in smoke

Discussion: Agenda is attached.

 

0 Updates were given on the following Applied projects pertinent to FF
prototype development efforts:

- Shorts Testin (H. Youn ) — Shorts have been blended into the cur-

rent WKS product at three usage levels ’.01 5, and 8%, and prod-
ucts were mailed out on MARC week of June 20. Topline results are
due week of July 27. One usage level will be chosen as the stan-

dard to be used for production of WKS.

— G7 vs G7A/Aged vs Unaged (H. Young) - Topline results from MARC
panel tests indicated that competitive FFNM 85 smokers (excluding
WINSTON) preferred product made with aged G7A over that made with
aged G? and franchise smokers had no preference fOr either.
Franchise smokers did have a preference for aged G7 product (cur-

rent) over that made with unaged 67A. Full report due within one
week.

— Reaction Flavors (A. Gonzalez) - Several reaction flavors from
different suppliers are being tested in the WKS product for en-
hancement of tobacco taste and possibly smoothness. Two products
containing reaction flavors are currently on Walker panels
(results due 7-22-83) and an additional four are being evaluated

by the Flavor Division.

0 Topline results for the following three additional studies are due
within the next two weeks and primary investigators (including H.
Young — Shorts Testing) have agreed to summarize test design and
results at the next Brands FF Team meeting in mid-August (5-10 minutes

per study):

- Tobacco Aging Study (L. Villegas)
- Full Flavor 'Tar' Limit Study (C. Neumann)

Re: WINSTON 100's "X", 16 mg Tar Unannounced Shipment Test

March 17, 1978

The purpose of this document is to outline the current status and
proposed timetable for unannounced shipment test of the WINSTON
100's 16 mg product.

Background

The WINSTON 100‘s Improved Product program was initiated in February,
1977, when NFO results determined that the current product was less
preferred to Marlboro in blind testing. Test results showed that
female WINSTON 100's smokers and all Marlboro smokers preferred
Marlboro 100's over WINSTON 100's. The primary reason for WINSTON's
lack of preference was its being perceived "too strong/harsh“ "less
smooth/mild" relative to Marlboro.

Accordingly, three lowered-tar blends were developed which were
judged to be milder than current WINSTON 100's. It was intended
that one of the products would be introduced into an "announced"

test market if it met the required action standards, which have since
been modified. The new "announcement" action standards specify:

° Significant preference over current among WINSTON smokers.

.

' Significant preference over Marlboro among WINSTON smokers.
(Additional element)

° Parity or better vs. Marlboro among Marlboro and B&H smokers.
(Same blend used in Marlboro and B&H)

' _Preference over Marlboro among other NFF smokers.

° Preference to be maximized versus females, the primary target
for the 100mm NFF category.

' TPM at 17 mgs or less.

Test Results

Blend #2 demonstrated significant advantages over current WINSTON

100's, although the blend did not fully meet the action standards

for "announcement" test market. Test results indicated that blend
#2 was:

Dear Sir:

In response to your concerns relative to the above referenced
order, you can be assured that the design-of this unit in no way

infringes on any existing patents.

The Bird Delta-Washer design employs an air-liquid separation
system which is cnmmcn practice an a11 Fnurdrinier paper machines
and makes no attempt to control the level within the individual
vacuum receptacles.

Furthermore, the patents for the original Fourdrinier type pulp
washer are owned and were developed by Ontario Paper Co. and
C.I.P. Co. from whom we license the rights to the Delta-Washer

technology.

In summary, we can assure you that the Bird Delta-Washer is free
of any infringement and, in fact, incorporates the most advanced
technology in countercurrent washing.

Re: Billboards

DearMessrs. Freedman & Cromer:

Thank you for your correspondence of March 3 and March 5, 1999, providing
additional information about your Ohio billboards so we could proceed with our
alternative advertising plans pursuant to MSA §III(d). As I informed you yesterday by
telephone, Ohio will proceed with placement of alternative advertising on all available
billboards, and to the extent anybillboards are no longer available, Ohio will accept
suitable and comparable substitute space of equivalent value.

Jane Kilgore of our Public Affairs staff has carefully reviewed the several lists
you provided and communicated directly with each of the outdoor advertising ﬁrms that
own or sell the space. Attached is the list of billboards we have compiled for placement
of Ohio’s alternative advertising program. In most instances, the billboards are those
you listed, and we have conﬁrmed availability with the vendor. In those instances
where the billboards were no longer available, we have arranged for substitute space of
equivalent value. Any such billboards are included in the attached list. For example,
Cleveland Outdoor Advertising informed us that the 14x48 billboard at W. 117 and [-90

o A meeting was held with RJR Archer representatives to develop
sampling schedules and strategies for ozone, toluene,
isocyanate and oil mists. Employees are being exposed to
these chemicals in the workplace.

0 Dr. John Kirschman will publish a paper on "Investigations of
dichloromethane metabolism and subchronic oral toxicity as the
basis for design of chronic oral studies in rats and mice" in

the November issue of Food and Chemical Toxicology.

0 An FDA Advisory Committee on Hypersensitivity to Food
Constituents has recommended an increase in research efforts
in the area of antigen characterization and the development of
an appropriate animal model, a reporting procedure for deaths
due to adverse food reactions to the Centers for Disease
Control, an increase in enforcement of good manufacturing
practices to prevent laws which exempt some ingredients from
food labels, and an increase in educational efforts toward
physicians, consumers and manufacturers regarding avoidance
and treatment of food reactions. The recommendations also
included the labeling of bulk foods sold in retail outlets and
to limit or phase- in the release of new food additives. The
committee also acknowledged the incidence of food reactions to
legumes which included peanuts and soybeans, seafood (accounts
for S to 10% of reactions in children), milk and eggs (10 to
25% of reactions in children, 0.1% in the general population),
tree nuts and chocolate. The committee also noted that
reactions to grain products are exceedingly rare and there is

no evidence that molds/yeasts produce adverse reactions.

TOBACCO PROJECTS

1. PUFFED TOBACCO
A. Tobacco Studies (Project 185: Fredrickson, Harper, llickman)

Study of the effect of sucker control agents on'the response of tobacco
to puffing processes is in progress. Composites of flue-cured tobacco from
Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia were used. The samples
were composites of the leaves from the upper two-thirds of the plant. Compo-
sites of burley from Kentucky, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia are
also being studied. The sucker control agents are two systemic agents, MH-30
and the potassium salt of maleic hydrazide, and four contact agents, l-octanol,
l—decanol, cocodimethylamine caprate, dimethyldodecylamine acetate (Penar).
Hand-suckered tobaccos were used as controls. All samples were puffed with
pentane/wet steam. All flue-cured samples treated with sucker control agents
were more responsive to puffing than the hand-suckered tobacco. However, the
increases in the filling value for the treated flue—cured samples were similar.
The increases in the intracellular volume measured with an air pycnometer were

more variable. No data are available for the burley sample at present.

The expansion of stalk composites of 15 commercial flue-cured varieties
grown at Oxford, North Carolina is in progress.

An exploratory study of the constituents involved in the thermo—plastic
deformation of tobacco during expansion has been initiated.

B. Smoke Studies (Project 180: Schumacher, Green)

Study of the particulate phase components of a control and wholly puffed
tobacco blend continues. Four of the 10 major chromatographic fractions from
the ether extract of each condensate have been investigated; study of a fifth
is well underway. Recent findings are shown on following page:

To: Mr. Richard J. Hall from: Dr. Rob Harrington

Below is an evaluation of Heldwood Contact Cement manufactured by DAP.
Inc. (Dayton. OH). Scientific Affairs approves the use of this product to
secure gaskets to apron dryer doors. Product contact with this adhesive
should be kept to a minimum. This adhesive contains solvents that may cause
dizziness. headache and other health effect. Proper ventilation and the use

of rubber gloves are recommended when applying this adhesive.

This adhesive is composed of neoprene rubber in a 1.1.1 trichloroethane/
dichloromethane base.

Chloroprene rubber (neoprene or latex) is a polymer made from chloroprene
monomers. It is commonly used to waterproof rubber materials such as gloves.
coatings. belts. tires. etc. Chloroprene (2-chloro~1.3-butadiene) is a color-
less flammable liquid with a high vapor pressure. In chronic studies with
mice and rats. chloroprene monomer was determined not to be carcinogenic. It
is not considered to be a teratogen. Chloroprene is a respiratory tract irri-
tant. At very high levels it can cause respiratory depression and asphyxia.

'At levels above 300 ppm chloroprene can produce toxic effects. The American
Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) has set a threshold

limit value (TLV) of 10 ppm for exposure in the workplace. Polychloroprene
rubber is essentially non toxic. It has an average molecular weight of

100,000. These polymers often contain sulfur. Pyrolysis products of the
monomer or polymer include hydrogen chloride (HCI). sulfur dioxide (50?). car-

bon monoxide (CO) and small amounts of chloroprene. benzene. acetic ac
mic acid. formaldehyde and various mercaptans.

1.1.l-trichloroethane (methyl chloroform) is a clear nonflammable liquid
with a very high vapor pressure. It has a low oral toxicity with an L0 (le-
thal dose to 50% of the test population) of approximately 8 g/kg (RCGIH.
Documentation of Threshold Limit Values and Biological Exposure Indices,
1986). It may also be absorbed through the skin. Contact with methyl chloro-
form rea ily de-fats the skin and may cause redness and scaling. Inhalation
exposures to 500 ppm for 7 hours a day for 6 months did not cause any adverse
effects in rats. rabbits or monkeys. High concentrations may cause anesthesia
and levels above 15,000 ppm may be fatal. It is not considered to be a car-

cinogen or a teratogen. Due to its low toxicity. the ACGIH has set a TLV of
350 ppm in the workplace. .

Dichloromethane (methylene chloride) is a colorless. highly volatile
liquid. It is used in paint removers. solvents. and degreasing agents. It
has a relatively low order of toxicity with an oral L050 (lethal dose to 50%

Re: American Marine Holdings, Inc. v. R.J. Reynolds
Tobacco Company and Gyro Advertising, Inc.

Dear Mike:

We have reviewed the responses of Plaintiff American Marine
Holdings, Inc. d/b/a Donzi Marine ("Donzi") to Defendant R.J.
Reynolds Tobacco Company‘s ("R.J. Reynolds") First Request for
Production of Documents and Things to Plaintiff and First Set of
Interrogatories to Plaintiff and find Donzi's responses to be
deficient in various respects. In an attempt to resolve these
issues informally, and avoid the necessity of a motion to

compel, we have set forth our objections to Donzi's production
below.

Donzi's responses to InterrogatorieS' Nos. 1 and 2 are
deficient. Donzi has failed to provide, for Donzi's boats
generally, annual sales (a) in dollars by country for model
years pre 1999 and (b) in units by state and country. Donzi has
also failed to provide, for its 28 ZX, annual sales in units and
dollars by state and country.

Since Donzi appears to be seeking corrective advertising
damages on both a national and international scale, annual
dollar and unit sales by state and country are necessary to
assess Donzi's damage calculations. That Donzi's records are
not generally kept in this manner does not relieve it of the

Re: germany ~ lax Classificatign

It has come to our attention today that the Ministry of
Finance is likely to tax SPA as a cigarette. This
unfortunate news comes as a result of a preliminary report

from the Customs Laboratory to the HOP.

In a meeting this morning with three MOP officials, w.
Dembach and J. Freund were informed that the Customs Lab had
analyzed our product, which is standard practice, and were
of the opinion that SPA's characteristics were most similar
to a cigarette. This enables, if not obliges, the M0? to
classify SPA under Section 3 of the tax law and apply a

cigarette tax rate.

It was stated at the meeting that this report was
preliminary and is not binding on the HOP. However, w.
Dembach did not see any indication that the HOP would rule

differently.

The meeting was called by Dr. Hafele, Parliamentary Under '
Secretary (deputy minister reporting to Minister of Finance,
Stoltenberg) and he invited Dr. Schmutzer (head of the
department responsible for these issues) and Mr. Dittrich
(the official directly in charge of RJR's request). Absent
from the meeting was Mr. Richter, who is Mr. Dittrich’s

superior and has been an advocate of RJR’s position.
Wilfried’s read on the situation is that Mr. Richter has not
been able to exert sufficient influence and is no longer a

major factor in the HOF’s decision.

Apparently, Dr. Hafele expressed the opinion that SPA could
be considered a cigarette product and taxed accordingly. He
went on to say that the political issues of SPA's investment
value and social benefits were of no concern to the MO? in
its interpretation of the law. In light of this, Wilfried
believes that Mr. Dittrich will feel encouraged to

recommend a cigarette tax rate.

SUBJECT: ETS Pilot B
Schedule (Draft)

DATE: March 16, 1988‘
§§§

\\‘

Human Pilot B has been tentatively scheduled from March 25 through
April 8. There are three primary objectives for this study.

1. To determine if rinsing the mouth prior to sample collection
influences the concentrations of nicotine and cotinine in urine

and saliva.

2. To rehearse the revised protocol, since the revisions include an
altered sampling schedule for urine and saliva and two groups of

subjects per day.

3. To determine how the new smoking regime influences the ETS
chamber parameters and nicotine/cotinine concentrations in

biological fluids.

SCHEDULE:

The pilot will consist of 4 subjects in two groups (A & B). The
subjects will be recruited by Bellomy Research.

Day 1 March 25 8:30 AM:
(Friday)

Group A (Subjects 1 & 2) and
Group B (Subjects 3 & 4) will pick up
their -24 hour urine containers.

Group A will begin collecting a 24 hour urine sample
at 8:00 AM on Sunday, March 27.

Group B will begin collecting a 24 hour urine sample
at 12:00 noon on Sunday, March 27.

Day 2 March 28 7:30 AM:
(Monday)

12:00 Noon:

Group A reports to BGTC. They will :0 ﬂ
eat breakfast at the BGTC cafeteria,

and report to the ETS chamber at

8:15. During exposure, they will rinse
their mouths prior to saliva collection.

Group B reports to BGTC. They will 'ﬂn
eat lunch at the BGTC cafeteria, O‘”‘,
and report to the ETS chamber at 12:45 PM. iJ“
During exposure, they will not rinse 19:

their mouths prior to saliva collection. \ M,
. F'

All subjects will be given 3 urine containers and a
cooler when they leave BGTC. A 6-24 hour sample will be

taken as well as a 24—48 hour, and a 48-72 hour sample.
Group A should be able to leave BGTC about 3:00 PM and
Group B should be able to leave at 7:00 PM.

mus FOR Hagar BRIEF

o Cigarette Banding Policy - Representatives from MDD, Brands R&D and R&D
73c nica rvices met to discuss procedures currently used for banding
test products. Changes in the tipping design and perforation location over

location on some products. This has caused some concern within MDD in com-
paring data from tests with the different locations. A new policy will be
written by mid-April, setting standards for banding width and location for
each style that may be run to ensure long-term consistency within each
brand style. Cases where uniquely designed tipping make these standards
unacceptable will be discussed with HDD and Brands before banding.

Dear Mike,

Considering the time I am presently spending on the project and the infrequency
at which we discuss my activities, I thought it was time to write a short note
summarizing my efforts. I am concerned about priorities too, so important areas
aren’t neglected or that effort isn’t squandered on back-burner activities.

Ms;

W -- Priority #1

Improvements are sought in the present substrate process of loading -14 + 20 mesh
alumina spheres into the aluminum capsule. Bead strength and attrition resistance
should be improved and the flow of the beads into the capsules could be
improved. Current efforts with Dick Haberkern and John Stewart are focused on
increasing theistrength of the substrate by doping the alumina prior to sintering.
Oxide additives such as Naz and MgO alter the pore structure during the sintering
process. The present concept is to maintain pore size at a minimum acceptable
with concomitant development of maximum pore volume. Since pores are stress
concentrators, large pores usually result in low strength. Some preliminary data
look promising in this respect, but continuing effort is required. Inorganic
powdered flow promoters. such as the tricalcium phosphate commonly used in
pharmaceutical products, are being screened to determine effectiveness.

MENTHOL DEVELOPMENT (MARUMERIZED)

STATUS: A MENTHOL PROTOTYPE USEING APCC AS A REPLACEMENT FOR ALUMINA
RECEIVED GOOD REVIEWS FROM INFORMAL TASTE PANELS AND PERFORMED BETTER
ON ANALYTICALS THAN THE CONTROL. THE APCC MARUMERIZED MENTHOL SUBSTRATE
WAS MADE BY ADDING THE MENTHOL DIRECTLY TO THE MIX VIA AN ALCOHOL
DILUTION THUS MAKING THE PROCESS MORE SIMPLE. A HEAT SOURCE HAVING

K-24 AND TURKISH TOBACCO COMPLIMENTED THE OVERALL TASTE. SIGNIFICANCE:
AN IMPROVED MENTHOL PRODUCT WITHOUT ALUMINA IS FEASIBLE. NEXT STEP:

FURTHER INVESTIGATE CARBON AS A ALUMINA REPLACEMENT IN MARUMERIZED

EVALUATED SEPERATELY, AND WORK TO COMBINE THEM IS UNDER WAY. SIGNIFICANCE:
MENTHOL YIELD WITH THE BAC PLUG IS SUFFICIENT WITH THE PAPER SUBSTRATE,

Dear Sir:

I wrote to different tobacco companies about my idea of
tobacco being connected with cancer. I am a full beleiver that
some type of vaccine--or shots is the cause of eancera This
vaccine is stronger than the disease you have and gets into your
veins, which immunes you to that particular disease. My theory
is that this vaccine lodges in your veins, after maybe a period
of years and causes a sore, which turns out to be cancer. It
happens in any part of your body.

We have people to die with cancer that has never smoked and

peOple to die with old age that did smoke, with out having

cancer.

Get a smear of the sore or cancer and test it with the

different vaccines.

Yours truly,

Dear Harmon

I enclose the competitive renewal application for our grant entitled “The
pharmacogenetics of lung cancer”. The following points may be of
assistance to the reviewers:

(i) The Progress Report shows that the recruitment of patients in Los
Angeles is almost complete. If we have finished the CYP2D6
genotyping assays prior to the next SAB meeting, I shall
communicate the outcome to you by letter.

(ii) Dr Daly and I have established the Newcastle group. with your
support. in a leading position in the new and emergent ﬁeld of
molecular epidemiology. As such, I have been invited to speak on
this work at the U.S.-Japan cancer meeting in Hawaii in February,
the Japan cancer meeting in Sapporo in July, together with three
other international meetings in 1994 in Toronto, Istanbul and North
Carolina. Clearly we wish to maintain our leading and inﬂuential
position in the field and thus renewal of our CTR grant. which is
central to our activities. is a matter of high priority for us.

[iii] We have been able to trim our expected budget to around the
$80,000 p.a. level because of the fall in the value of Sterling.

With kind regards.

Yours sincerely

Dear Ms. Lipic:

Thank you for your interest in The Tobacco
Institute's new youth initiatives. These initiatives
are designed to discourage young people from smoking
and to prevent their access to cigarettes. These steps
expand upon and reaffirm previous actions taken by the
industry to steer its product away from young people.

I'm happy to send you several copies of "Tobacco:
Helping Youth Say No," as you requested. The booklet
is designed to help adults help children resist peer
pressure to smoke. The booklet provides guidance and
actual techniques parents can use to talk to their
children about peer pressure, which is one of the
primary reasons children smoke. It can also be used by
educators, to help them in discussing the subject with

students.

The industry is committed to a long-term program
to discourage young people from smoking.

Sincerely,

WMMM

Dear Jim:

I presume each member of the Steering Group received a cover
note, a project goal description and a budget from Jack Kelly,
like the enclosed one which came here and which you showed us
in New York.

Surely we look for more than 600- 800 cards from the survey of
California' s "industry personnel", which are discussed in item I
entitled ”Industry Inventory." I should think the Industry would
be defined broadly enough to garner several hundred thousand names.
Perhaps there needs to be a hard core of 600- 800 and, on top of
that, a contact group on which we have names and addresses number-
ing in the hundreds of thousands. But all of this should be in
the statewide tobacco action network.

My best regards.

Cordially,

Dear Len:

Thank you so much for enclosing that exceedingly interesting paper by
Martensson. Larsson and lettergren dealing with malignant mesothelioma
in siblings. It is of interest that cases one and two are both epithelial
types of malignant mesothelioma. Finally. and most extraordinary. in
cases three and four. both were biphasic types and had the dominating
fibrous component. The latter were identical twins. This. of course.
fosters our hypothesis of high genetic specificity relevant to the
histologic form of mesothelioma. This is very timely indeed in that we
_ have a paper (enclosed) in press in Cancer Genetics and Cytogenetics.
This project of mine was supported by CTR I will let you now w en it
g is published which should be very shortly since I returned the galleys.

Things are moving slo . but hopefully. steadily with respect to HCl.

SUBJECT: Government Relations Status Report‘

0 On October 29, the Senate approved by voice vote an amendment to the _
FY 1988 Transportation Appropriations bill that would prohibit-smoking

on commercial airline flights of 1 1/2 hours or less for a period of
two years. This amendment was substituted for Senator Lautenberg’s_

proposal to ban smoking on flights of two hours or less for a period
of three years. Earlier this year, the House approved an amendment to
its version of the FY 1988 Transportation Appropriations bill that
would prohibit smoking on flights of two hours or less for an
unlimited period of time. The two bills will now go to a conference
committee where the differences between the bills' smoking provisions
will be resolved. , '

o On October 29, the House approved its budget reconciliation bill by a
vote of 206 to 205. The bill raises $12.8 billion in new revenues
without increasing excise taxes on cigarettes or denying deductions
for tobacco product advertising and promotion expenses. The Senate is
expected to consider its version of the reconciliation bill next week.
Simultaneous to this action in‘the House and Senate are the daily
meetings of the budget summit between the Administration and Congress.

Even if we survive in the House and Senate budget reconciliation bills
without a cigarette tax increase, we could still be vulnerable to an

excise tax hike if the budget summit recommends revenues above that in
the reconciliation bills.

Dear George Hashim,

The graduate students in the Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental
Biology are hostinga symposium entitled: Pattern'and Polarity: Establishing
Difference in Development It will be held April 12—14, 1996. '1 This symposium will
explore the ways both'single celled organisms and multicellular organisms establish axes
and pattern for asymmetric cell division and embryonic development, and will include
discussion of organisms as diverse as bacteria, yeast, algae, nematodes, insects, and
vertebrates. This letter is written to request ﬁnancial assistance-for our graduate student

symposium.

This will be the sixteenth‘symposium organized by the graduate students in MCD
Biology. ' A unique feature of this event is that it is organized and run entirely by
graduate students from our department. These symposia allow us torinteract with
prominent scientists from diverse disciplines one—on—one, and introduce us to, deeper .
insights into many important queStions- facing biologists today. These symposia also '
serve to enliven'the scientiﬁc atmosphere of the region by bringing-prominent biologists
frOm around the world to Boulder,

In the past, the Graduate Student Symposium has been made possible by generous
donations from biotechnology companies, from companies that do business with
researchers in the Boulder area, and from others interested inbiology. The total cost of , I
the symposium, the majority of which is used for transportation-and lodging of the v
speakers, is estimated at 15,000 dollars. Past contributions have-ranged from 500 to
3500 dollars; Any contribution would be greatly appreciated, and acknowledgedboth at
the symposium and in the symposium program which is given to each attendee.

Enclosed please ﬁnd a tentative schedule for this year’s Symposium, as well as schedules
from past symposia. A member of the Graduate Student Symposium Organizing ,
Committee will be contacting you by phone to discuss this request. Wewould like to ,.
thank you for your time and effort, and hope that you'are as excited about this year’s

symposium aswe are.

Dear Hans :

After talking to you I had Cleve Laird prepare an
application—type statement for a supplement to our current
contract between Bio-Research Institute,Inc.and CTR to enable
us to study respiratory sounds and certain other physiological'
parameters in smoke—exposed Syrian hamsters.Preliminary work
showed that this non-destructive approach promises to furnish
a wealth of information relatively soon after beginning the
exposure.0nce the Comparison between in vivo sound tracings,
respiratory frequencies and magnitudes and anatomical findings
wilé have been made this will provide a new approach to the 1:
study of effects of smoke upon pulmonary function and health.

Unfortunately through an unbelievable mix—up in the mails
this material,mailed from Boston on August 15th reached me this
morning.No time remains now for cleaning it up and I am sending
it to you in its present draft form which conveys the meaning.

I hope you can convince your colleagues on the CTR advi—
sory committee that this is a worthwhile effort and that we can
get the funds to purchase the equipment which we have currently
borrowed and improvised .

I am sending Bob Hockett copies of all of this so that he
is informed of our discussions.

with ,any thanks and best regards, ;f

P.S. I just learned that Dr.Lisanti visited us today and isL/jl1;04:;
informed on this.It is important that we get immediate actigady Hombu er

so that we can use for study the animals now being exposeu.

and I do not ow how long we can keep it.

Gentlemen:

Enclosed are three items I received recently bearing on smokers' rights and
proposed taxes and restrictions on the use of tobacco:

One is an article by Bruce Herschensohn published in HUMAN EVENTS newspaper
titled "Let Free Market Decide Smoking Rules," a concept I totally agree with,

as the free market has always proven to be far more effective than government
regulation.

Another enclosure is a mailing I received (as publisher of a national news-
paper) from a public relations firm including a short article on the subject
of the regulation of tobacco use. Well written and full of useful information.

The final enclosure is a publication from Florida Tax Watch (a non—profit
state government watchdog organization) expressing the unsound proposal of a

proposed increase in the state tax on tobacco.

I hope you may be able to use some portion of these enclosures in your contin—
uing efforts to protect the rights of smokers in our supposedly free country.

Summary and Key Brand Style Puff Count Strategy, which outline
our proposed action plans, timetables, and the costs to achieve
competitive puff count parity on 32 brand styles. The cost
impact is projected to be approximately $21 million, which is
primarily associated with increased tobacco rod weight.

RE: Moviegoer Meeting March 16

 

This will report on our meeting with Christ Whittle at which 13-30
presented an update and stewartship report in resnonse to my letter

of February 28.

Overall, 13—30 appears to be delivering the staffing and services
required by the contract or spelled out in the original 1981 proposal.
In those cases where there are exceptions, they seem to have a

reasonable explanation.

The following is a brief summary on each area covered:

Field Staffing

Internal and field staffing equals or exceeds that outlined in the
original proposal. While some of the internal and field staffing also
spend time on other 13—30 properties, it seems that overall the
original requirements are being met. _0ne significant change involves
the substitution of full-time service reps in place of part—time

service people.

 

 

 

Monitoring

Monitoring and restocking of books is maintained on a twice weekly
basis vs. the original plan to service weekly. Area managers now
meet with chain theatre personnel every 6 months to maintain

 

 

A relationship, deal with problems, etc. A toll free phone service
is now available to theatre managers to identify problems and request
service.

Circulation by Market

3 A sunmary of circulation by market is attached. We also have theatre
‘ detail by market available. This circulation has not changed
significantly over the past 2 years.

 

Market Analysis of Annual Reader Poll

Reader response polls, conducted via insert cards, were part of the
original plan. These have been executed to determine movie preference,
frequency of moviegoing, etc. We may also use this service to detenmine
demographics, brand preferences, etc. We can also use full run card

inserts on a cost basis for promotion purposes.

Alternate Approaches to Low—Sidestream Cigarettes Date: December 21, 1982

Dr. A. Rodgman From: I). E. Townsend
Dr. D. H. Piehl
Mr. J. D.Phillips

Several staff members in RED have obtained information which is applicable
to the development of low-sidestream cigarettes. I have prepared two
low-sidestream prototypes, one with information obtained by Dr. J. L. Harris
and the other with Earris' information combined with the use of "carbonized“
filler provided by Mr. J. White. Informal smoking suggests that these
prototypes do not exhibit the harsh, irritating mainstream taste and irritating
sidestream aroma which is common to the current OC-prototypea.

Dr. Harris has demonstrated (new, 1982, No. 50; cm, 1980, No. 27; cm,
1977. No. 4) that the use of cigarette paper made without Caco filler results
in very low smolder rates and hence low sidestream deliveries. The major
disadvantage is that due to the reduced smolder rate, the puff count is
extraordinarily high ("20-25 puff/sis). He suggested that unusual
configurations are required to obtain cigarettes with reasonable deliveries and
puff counts.

Prototype DET-lll682-B was prepared with Caco -free cigarette paper
(supplied by Schweitzer) and 27.5mm long non air-diluted filters made with
2.9/44.000'tow. NOW 100 blend (high 6-13 level) was used in an effort to
reduce the puff count to acceptable levels. The results of smoke analyses are
presented in Table 1. It is clear that as compared to WINSTON KS (SS 'tar'
‘ZSmg/cix). substantial reductions ('50!) in measured sidestream 'tar' were
achieved while satisfactory mainstream delivery and acceptable puff count were
obtained.

Prototype DET-lllGBZ-A was similar to that described above except that the
filler included 302 “carbonized" flue-cured stems (obtained from Mr. J. Uhite).
Mr. White has demonstrated that the use of "carbonized" filler in a blend
results in reduced sidestream deliveries. The results of smoke analyses for
this prototype are also presented in Table l. A comparison of samples A and B
shows that the use of “carbonized“ fill’er resulted in further sidestream 'tar'
reduction. The sidestream 'tar' analysis for prototype A must be regarded as
only an upper limit, however. Dr. Harris has demonstrated that the routine
method for measurement of sidestream 'tar' is in error for cigarettes which
contain “carbonized" filler. The actual 'tar' delivery is somewhat less than
that measured due to a higher extinction coefficient for SS 'tar' from

cigarettes with "carbonized" filler. Thus, all we can say at this point is
that the sidestream 'tar' reduction is in excess of ‘602.

The results of visible sidestream measurements are unavailable at this

time due to the load and priority of (Xi-prototypes. However, it is clear that
the visible sidestream is very low.

Attention: Mr. Robert B. Walker-
‘Chairman of the Board

Gentlemen:

I doubt if this letter will get to the Chairman of the
Board, but anyway, I am a stockholder in the American Tobacco
Company and received your communication of October 25th, and I
frankly think the tobacco industry is hiding behind a log. As

“long as Kennedys can keep this as a whipping boy, they will con-

tinue to do so, and of course, it is purely for their personal

, gain and not the public.

I have wondered why the tobacco industry has not asked
the Government why not label whiskey as dangerous to your health,
paregoric which can be bought at any drug fountain in small quan-
tities, and many other household items such as aspirin, etc. I
have wondered why the tobacco industry did not get the producers
association and different farm organizations busy on this, because

it is not going to end until someone makes it politica11y unprofit-;

able for the food and drug administration and Kennedys to make an
issue of it.

I have practiced law since 1933, have had a lot of deal-
ings with the medical profession, and how in the Hell they can say
that tobacco causes cancer, when they do not know what cancer is,
is beyond me, but at any rate, it is a popular subject. I remember
twenty years ago, when if a person had a bellyache he was automatic-
ally operated on for appendicitis, and that fed has blown over with
the medical profession. Also the tonsillectomy for all children
has blown over. I well remember when the medical profession sa
that Blue Cross would destroy the nation, and now they are the w
greatest believer in it, and it has enhanced their earnings. Also

Re: Grant No. 2723Rl

Dear Dr. Paulus:

The Council for Tobacco Research, USA, Inc. is pleased to award you a renewal grant
in the amount of $68,138.00 for the period from July 1, I991 through June 30, 1992 for the
study proposed in your application “Adaptation of Yeast to Osmotic Stress.” It is understood
that this grant is made subject to acceptance by institutional authorities. Also, many
applications to CTR indicate partial or complete overlap with applications to other agencies.
If the latter result in awards, we should be promptly notified so that we can negotiate an
appropriate adjustment of our award.

The award is made without guarantee of support beyond June 30. I992, even though
we recognize that your original application proposed a study extending one year beyond that
date. Therefore, if by November 30, l99l you submit to us a formal renewal application,
including a report of your progress to date, your request will receive consideration.

Your attention is called to the enclosed “Important Procedural information for
Grantees‘. Please fill in the attached “Notice of Research Project” and return it to me. Drs.
Donald Ford, Associate Research Director, and Harmon McAllister, Scientific Director, will
serve as your primary contact with our scientific staff on matters concerning your grant.
Please consult the staff as questions or problems arise, and keep us informed about the
progress of your study.

As Principal Investigator, you should know that CTR recovers unexpended balances at
the end of each grant year. We suggest that you personally keep an accurate record of
expenditures and commitments to assure that you agree with your institution’s official
financial statement at the end of the grant year. Please note that year-end deficits cannot be
recovered from CTR, even from funds awarded in a subsequent year. Finally. please be
aware that our failure to receive timely annual financial statements from your grants office
will stop further grant payments. Appropriate forms will be sent to your financial officer at
the end of the grant year. Administrative problems are relatively rare and we hope that this
statement of our fiscal policies will obviate any possible misunderstandings.

Cordially,

SUBJECT: Petition Against Tobacco Regulation

In October, we sent you petition packs to combat a very serious threat by the anti-tobacco
forces to encourage the food and drug administration (FDA) to place severe regulations on

cigarettes. The petitions were to be placed at selected retail locations.

Thus far. the responses have been minimal and we encourage you to follow-up with retailers to
return completed petitions as soon as possible. The deadline for petition returns has been

extended to December 31 1994.

 

The threat against our industry is very real. The power shift in Congress in no way diminishes
this threat. Our goal Is to demonstrate, by the petitions we receive, that smokers and the
general public are against any further regulations on tobacco.

Please do what you can to have the petitions mailed in by December 31, 1994.

Dear Dr. Karin:

  
      
    
      
 
   
     
     

I am writing to you as a current or former grantee of The Council for Tobacco
Research, USA, Inc., in order to infomi you of one aspect of the agreement recently reached

by the Attorneys General of several states and representatives of the tobacco industry, our
funding sponsors.

This agreement, which will require Congressional legislation for implementation, calls
for disbanding and dissolving The Council for Tobacco Research within 90 days after such
legislation goes into effect. Anticipating that such legislation may be enacted, we have decided
that it will not be prudent for us to fund further grant applications,

  

Accordingly, we have suspended review of all new and competing renewal grant
applications. However, we intend to meet the obligations we have to current grantees, In short,
those of you who have an active grant with CTR can expect that our obligation to you “ill be
met, but no new grant applications or competing renewals will be considered.

I deeply regret this decision. I believe that the vicious attack on CTR by the Attorneys
General reﬂected a profound misunderstanding of the mission of CTR in supporting the
biomedical research community. It is unfortunate that this action \w'll deprive the scientiﬁc
community of $20 million dollars annually that might well be spent on important scientiﬁc
research. This ill-considered demand by the Attorneys General m'll penalize the biomedical

research community and the public at large. You have the collective good wishes of the staff of
The Council for Tobacco Research and our sponsors.

Letter to the Editor of Personnel Administrator

 

 

To the Editor:

As the owner of a company with about 100 employees, I found
Lewis Solmon‘s recent article, "The other side of the smoking
worker controversy," interesting. I'd like to share my own

views, since I've had some experience with the issue.

A small but vocal group of employees have pressured me to
either ban smoking or to segregate smokers and nonsmokers.
When they first approached me I considered the situation but,

for several reasons, decided against any restrictions.

First, implementing smoking policies would have required .
that I take action against good employees who have worked

for me for quite some time. Second, to implement a smoking
policy would have disrupted my company's work process, since,
as in many offices, employees with similar skills and responsi-

bilities work together.

Furthermore, once I took a hard look at the situation, I dis-
covered that the vast majority of my employees were neither

aware of nor particularly interested in the problem.

I have not read any of Weis' articles to which Solmon referred
nor have I considered the economic aspect of the argument on
which Solmon's article was based. But common sense suggests
that rearranging people, changing policies, implementing rc-

strictions, and disrupting my workforce won't save me meney.

Sincerely,

Re: SALEM LIGHT; Defensive P131

 

As you know, the Arctic Lights brand is scheduled to begin

national advertising on March 26, 1979. Inasmuch as the Arctic Lights
brand will not be introduced until late March, 1979, the

SALEM LIGHTS defensive effort should begin April, 1979. The result'

would be to alter the national break of the Defensive Plan by
one week in 120+ Market Importance groupings.

Therefore, this requests that the national break of the SALEM

Dear Mr. Pinney:

Thank you for your invitation to participate in the
"Working Meeting: Research Needs on Low—Yield Cigarettes“.

The following are some of the questions which I believe
bear examination in future research on the effects of Cigarette
Smoking on the pregnant mother, the fetus and placenta, and the
child. As you will note many are those I formulated for the
chapter on Pregnancy and Infant Health for the 1979 Surgeon'
General‘s Report on Smokina and Health. (I apologize for the
sketchy nature of some of these questions, but I am writing

this letter during a few hours between a trip to Boston and
another to Amsterdam.)

Lactation and Breast Feeding

l.~ By what mechanism does nicotine affect prolactfh Eég~3
release, and can this phenomenon be reversed? w»

2. To what extent is nicotine excreted in breast
milk ingested by the nursing infant?'

3. What other components of cigarette smoke are
secreted in significant amounts in breast milk?

4. Do interactions between nicotine and other drugs
such as benzo(u)pyrene excreted in breast milk __V, ~
affect newborn physiology?

RE: Weekly Highlights - Biochemical/Biobehavioral Group

Scientific Affairs

 

Additives - Ms. Joyce Dickerson from Archer asked that we
review the styrene/butadiene polymers used as moisture
barriers in cigarette packs. Dr. Deskin met with Mr. Don
Murray and Mr. Elmer MarSh of Westvaco to define the
information required for an aSseSsment of potential product
effects due to contact with tobacco. Most of this information

muSt be Supplied by the synthesizers who are major chemical
companies.

The EaStman Kodak representatives presented a séminar on a new
filter additive which is supposed to reduce the tar to

nicotine ratio. The additive is an unsaturated fatty acid
which is added to the filter.

Product Contamination — R&D will analyze contaminated tobacco
for titanium. Before insurance claims can be processed,

quantitative data must be gathered which determines the
contamination level. The tobacco is currently being held in a
bonded warehouse. The value of the tobacco is approximately
1.2 million dollars of both finished cigarettes and
unprocesSed tobacco. The improper type of paint was used
which contained titanium dioxide. The type recommended by
RJRT engineers was not used by the contractor.

Meetings — Human Research Review Committee — Approval for
evaluating the senSory effects of MESNA as a filter additive

and the changes in oral pH due to smoking comparative products
and/or flavorings was granted.
