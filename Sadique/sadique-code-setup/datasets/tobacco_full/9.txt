Abstract

Activating the protein-tyrosine kinase activity of v-Fps
leads to the rapid transcriptional activation of the Egr-t
gene, which encodes a mitogen-responsive
transcription factor. Activation of [gut by v-Fps was
insensitive to protein kinase C depletion, suggesting
that a protein Irinase C-independent signal activated by
v-Fps leads to the induction of Egr- 1. Expression of v.
Fps in transient expression assays induced Egr-t
promoter activation. v-HaRas and v-Rai also aciivated
the {gr—l promoter). To characterize HaRas and Rat-t
involvement in v-Fps-induced [gr-1 expression, we
used recently characterized dominant negative mutants
of HaRas and Rat-1. v-Fps-induced Egr-t promoter
activation was inhibited by the dominant negative
mutants of both Haltas and Rat-1. v-HaRas-induced
Egr-I promoter activation was blocked by the negative
Raf-t mutant; however, v-Rai-I-induced Egr-t
promoter activation was unaffected by the inhibitory
Hallas mutant. these data suggest that v-l-‘ps activates a
protein kinase C ~independent intracellular signaling
pathway that is dependent on both HaRas and Rai- 1,
where Ral~t iunctions downstream of HaRas.

Molecular Consequences of awdbs, A Cell—Autonomous Lethal Mutation

of Drosophi/a Induced by Hybrid Dysgenesis

CHARLES R. DEAROLF,1 NICK TRIPOULAS, JOE BIGGs, AND ALLEN SHEARN
Department of Biology, The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland 21218

Accepted May 2, 1,988

The abnowmlm'ng disc locus, which is at salivary gland chromosome position 10OC-D of the Drosophila melanogaster
genome. has been identiﬁed by a recessive lethal mutation, awd’“, induced by hybrid dysgenesis. When homozygous, this
mutation causes abnormal development of the brain, the ovaries, and the larger imaginal discs as described in the
preceding paper (C. R. Dearolf, E. Hersperger, and A. Shearn, 1988, Dev. Biol 129, 159—168). The DNA corre-
sponding to this locus was isolated from a genomic library prepared from awd’“ heterozygotcs by screening with a
P-element probe. The mod” allele resulted from the insertion of a P»element fragment into a gene that encodes an 0.8-kb
poly(A)+ RNA. In mutant larvae, that 0.8-kb transcript is replaced by two chimeric transcripts that are 0.7 and 1.8 kb in
length, both of which contain P-element and and sequences. The wild-type owd“ gene transcript is most abundant
during the second and third larval instars but is found at a lower level during every developmental stage as well as in
continuous cell lines, Thus the mod” gene transcript can be detected in normal larvae at a developmental stage long
before defects are expressed in mutant larvae. Moreover, some tissues, for example the salivary gland of nonmutant,
third-instar larvae, contain high levels of this transcript, even though these tissues appear to develop normally in

mutant larvae. @1988 Academic Press, Inc.

INTRODUCTION

The abnormal wing discs (awd) gene of Dmsophila was
identiﬁed in a screen for hybrid-dysgenic late larval/
early pupal lethal mutations (Dearolf et at, 1988). The
most obvious defect caused by mutations at this locus is
the abnormal morphology of wing discs dissected from
homozygous mutant, third—instar larvae. Such discs are
smaller than normal discs of a comparable age, they are
misshapen, and they are incapable of differentiating a
normal inventory of wing structures. Further studies
revealed that the eye-antenna and leg discs are also
affected by the mutation. Although those discs appear
morphologically normal, they are also incapable of dif-
ferentiating a normal inventory of imagine] structures,
In addition to these imaginal disc defects, which were
shown to be cell autonomous, it was observed that
transplanted mutant ovaries were sterile and that the
mutant central nervous system was histologically ab—
normal (Dearolf, 1986; Dearolf et at, 1988).

The developmental consequences caused by the 41de
lethal mutation provided some inferences about the
normal requirements for the product of the gene
(Dearolf et at, 1988). It was inferred that during em-
bryogenesis and early larval development the mud"
gene is not required, that during the second half of
normal larval development the awn?” gene is required in

the wing disc as well as in the brain, and that somewhat
later in development it is required in the eye—antenna
and leg discs and the ovary.

However, the normal pattern of gene transcription
cannot necessarily be determined from the analysis of
the developmental consequences of mutations
(McKeown et al., 1987; Hartley et at, 1987). In order to
determine the pattern of gene transcription for owd, we
have isolated both genomic DNAs and cDNAs which
correspond to the awd gene, analyzed the pattern of
accumulation of the owd+ transcript during normal de-
velopment, and analyzed the effect of the mod” muta-
tion on that pattern. These results considerably extend
what was inferred about the expression of the awd gene
from studying the developmental consequences of mu-
tations in the gene and have provided the foundation for
identifying the awd protein.

Summary

Lp(a) competes with plasminogen for binding to cells but it is not
known whether this competition is due to the ability of Lp(a) to interact
directly with plasrninogen receptors. In the present study, we demon-
strate that Lp(a) can interact directly with plasminogen binding sites on
nionocytoid U937 cells and endothelial cells. The interaction of Lp(a)
with these sites was time dependent, speciﬁc, saturable, divalent ion in»
dependent and temperature sensitive, characteristics of plasminogen
binding to these sites. The afﬁnity of plasminogcn and Lp(a) for these
sites also was similar (Kd : 1-3 uM), but Lp(a) bound to fewer sites
(~10-fold less). Both gangliosides and cell surface proteins with car-
boxy—terminal lysyi residues, including cnolase, a candidate plzismino-
gen receptor, inhibited Lp(a) binding to U937 cells. Additionally, Lp(a)
interacted with low afﬁnity lipoprotein binding sites on these cells
which also recognized LDL and HDL. The ability of Lp(a) to interact
with sites on cells that recognize plasminogen may contribute to the
pathogenetic consequences of high levels of circulating Lp(a).

Introduction

Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is a distinct lipopmtein particle, which is as-
sociatcd with the development of premature atherosclerosis and with
disease processes involving thrombosis (1—7]. Lp(a) has a structure si-
milar to low density lipoprotein (LDL) but contains an unique apopro»
tein, apoprotein(a) [apo(a)], which is disulﬁde-linkcd to apoB-lOO.
Apo(a) is highly homologous to plasminogen. The cDNA of the, apo(a)
isoforrn which was sequenced predicted a structure containing 38
kringles, disulﬁde-looped structures of ~80 amino acids; of these, 37
were 75—85% identical to kringle 4 of plasminogen and one was 91%
identical to kringle 5 of plasminogen (8) The kringies of plasminogen
possess lysine binding functions and are important in mediating the
interactions of plasminogen with its substrates and inhibitors Lp(a)
particles also may exhibit lysine binding properties and interfere with

functions of plasininogen which depend upon kringle-mediated inter-
actions (945)

Plasminogen interacts with cell surfaces via its kringles (16). The in-
teraction of plasrninogcn with cells has ptoﬁbrinolytic consequences,
and Lp(a) competes for the interaction of plasminogen with cells
(1-7—19). This competition inhibits plasrninogcn activation on cell sur-
faces ( 19, 20), an effect which may contribute to the thrombotic and
atherosclerotic risks associated with high levels of circulating Lpt a).
The interpretation of these experiments has been that Lp(a) binds to
plasminogen receptors. Although apo(a) binds directly to endothelial
cells, it was not shown whether this interaction was inhibited by plas—
minogen (19). Lp(a) binding to human monocyte-derived macrophages
has been demonstrated, but a potential contribution of plasminogen
binding sites was not evaluated in this study (21). Indeed. apota) has
the ability to interact with adherent skin ﬁbroblasts via mechanisms
not shared with plasminogen (22). Moreover. direct interaction of
apo(a) with a mouse macrophage cell line (P388D.I) was inhibited by
acetylated LDL and was totally unaffected by plasminogen (23).

Based upon these inconsistencies, we have sought to test whether the
intact Lp(a) particle can interact directly with plasminogen binding
sites on cells. Complicating such an analysis are the interactions of
Lp(a) with lipoprotein binding sites on cells. Interaction of Lp(a) with
the high afﬁnity apoB/E receptor for LDL has been demonstrated
although Lp(a) appears to have a lower afﬁnity for these sites (24—26).
Interaction of modiﬁed Lp(a) with the scavenger receptor, which also
binds other modiﬁed (acetylated or oxidized) but not native Iipopro-
teins. has been demonstrated (27). Finally, many cells express “non—
selective" lipoprotein binding sites (28 —3 l ). These sites bind both LDL
and HDL. Such interactions are presumably dependent upon the lipid or
hydrophobic character of the lipoprotein particles. To dissect the inter-
action of Lp(a) with plasminogen binding sites, we have selected
speciﬁc cell types, culture conditions and assay conditions to block its
interaction with lipoprotein binding sites.

Experimental Procedures

Proteins and lipopmter'rzr. Lp(a) was prepared from fresh human plasma by
flotation centrifugation followed by afﬁnity chromatography on lysine-Sepha-
rose and CsCl density gradient ccntrifugation as described (32, 33). No conta-
mination of the preparations by plasminogcn was detected by either Coomassie
Blue staining of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) gels or by treatment with strep-
tokinasc and measuring plasrnin activity with a Chromogenic substrate. $2251.
The sensitivities ofthcsc assays excluded plasmin(ogen) contamination of>l€k
and >0.4%, respectively. Lp(a)-free LDL (21), HDL (34) and acetylated LDL
(35) were prepared as previously described. The LDL contained no apoA-l and

The E7 gene of human papillomavirus type 16 encodes a multifunctional nuclear phosphoprotein that is
functionally and structurally similar to the adenovirus (Ad) ElA proteins and the T antigens of other
papovaviruses. E7 can cooperate with an activated ms oncogene to transform primary rodent cells, trans
activate the Ad E2 promoter, and abrogate transforming growth factor [Eu-mediated repression ofc-myc. Recent
studies suggest that these functions may in part be a consequence of the ability of E7 to associate with the
product ofthe retinohlastoma tumor suppressor gene (pRB). In this study, a series ofsite-speciﬁc mutations of
the human papillomavirus type 16 E7 gene product were constructed and assessed for their effects on
intracellular protein stability, ms cooperativity, transcriptional tron: activation, pRB association, and
phosphorylation. The results of these studies indicate that the transforming and trans-activating domains
extensively overlap within a region of the protein analogous to conserved region 2 of Ad ElA, suggesting that
pRB binding is necessary for both activities. Deletion of sequences in conserved region 1 abrogates cellular
transformation but has only a marginal died on Iran: activation. These data suggest that E7 trans activation

and cellular transformation are interrelated but separable functions.

 

Both epidemiological and biological data support the divi-
sion of thc mucosa-associated human papillomaviruscs
(HPVS) into two groups: those associated with benign le-
sions, including condyloma acuminala, which are at low risk
for malignant progression (HPV type 6 [HPVG] and HPVII),
and those represented by HPVlé and HPVIS, which are
considered high risk because of thcir association with intra-
cpirhclial ncoplasia, a precursor to cervical canccr (37), The
E7 proteins of the high«risk HPVs, which are consistently
expressed in HPV-positivc cervical carcinomas and derived
ccll lincs (3, 42, 43), can induce morphological transforma-
tion of established rodcnt cells in culture (7, 22, 37, 49, 50,
52). E7 also can coopcratc with an activated ms or fax
oncogene to transform primary rodcnt cells (37, 48), The
expression ofthc high-risk HPV E6 and E7 proteins together
can efﬁciently inducc immortalization of primary human
epithelial cells (19, 20, 29).

The HPV16 E7 protein is an acidic 21-kDa nuclcar phos-
phoprotcin with no known enzymatic activity. The amino
terminus of the HPV E7 protein shares substantial amino
acid sequence similarity with two noncontiguous portions of
the adenovirus (Ad) EIA proteins (37). In addition, E7 is
functionally related to EIA and simian virus 40 (SV-iO] large
T antigen in that it can cooperate with rats, [runs activate the
Ad E2 promoter (37), and abrogatc the transforming growth
factor B-induced transcriptional repression of the c-myc
promoter in keratinocytcs (38). The amino acid sequences in
conserved region 2 (CR2) of each of these oncoprotcins are
required for their association with pRB, the product of thc
retinoblastoma tumor susceptibility gene (5, 6, 13, 1-1, 30, 53,
54).

Previous genetic studies indicated that CR1 and CR2 arc
rcquircd for EIA cellular transformation functions, including
stimulation of host DNA synthesis, cooperation with nix,
pRB association, and transcriptional rcprcssion of certain

genes. In contrast, CR3 of EIA, which is prcscnt in the
product of the Ad E1A 13$ RNA but not in thc product of
the 125 RNA, is responsible for thc major ElA-mcdialcd
transcriptional trans-activation function (9. It]. 32). Amino
acid sequences that are similar to that of Ad EIA CR3 are
not prcscnt in SV-li) T antigen or in thc E7 proteins of the
HPVs, suggcsting that this transcriptional regulatory region
is uniquc l0 EiA.

A rcccnt anal sis of HPV16 E7 trans activation indicated
that the binding sitcs for the Cellular transcription factor EZF
arc necessary for activation of thc Ad E2 promoter by both
E7 and EIA. Rcccnt studies have indicated thatthc E21:
transcription factor is a cellular targct for thc pRB protcin (2,
11, 12), The E7 protcin is functionally similar to the 125 ElA
product in that it can perturb the association of EZF with
ccllulur proteins, including cyclin A and pRB (34).

In this study, a series of HPV16 E7 mutants were anzilyzcd
to map the domains involved in the transcriptional trims
activation and cellular transformation functions of the E7
gene product. These data suggest that for IIPV E7, ccllular
transformation and trans activation of the Ad E2 promoter
arc related but separable functions. Cellular transformation
required two scpnratc regions analogous to the Ad EIA CR1
and CR2 domains, and transcriptional mm: activation
mapped to an overlapping region of the CR2 domain.

2.2. Measurement and estimation of smoke
dosage to non—smokers from environmental
tobacco smoke

MARTIN J. JARVIS AND MICHAEL A. H. RUSSELL

INTRODUCTION

Recent increased public awareness and con-
cern about environmental tobacco smoke
(ETS) has derived from a number of epidem-
iological studies which have suggested signiﬁ-

cant risks to the health of the exposed non—

smoker. Some studies have found that young
children with smoking parents have an
increased risk of bronchitis and pneumonia,
especially in the ﬁrst year of life (1, 2). Adults
chronically exposed to ETS have been reported
to have impaired lung function (3) and an
increased risk of lung cancer (4—6). The issue
has provoked intense debate (7-9), and it is fair
to say that the reality of the risks is not as yet
generally accepted by the scientiﬁc commu-
nity. One of the weaknesses of the studies so far
performed is that they have not attempted to
quantify the actual dose of ETS received by the
non-smoker, although, as one critic has argued,
this is fundamental to evaluation of the evi—
dence (10).

Epidemiological investigation of the risks of
ETS exposure would beneﬁt from both a reli-
able non-invasive marker and a validated ques—
tionnaire for assessing the degree of exposure.
While blood carboxyhaemoglobin (COHb) has
been found to be of use in short-term studies, it

is not speciﬁc to tobacco smoke and may not be
sufﬁciently sensitive to reflect the totality of
exposure across the whole range of situations
occurring in daily life. Thiocyanate (SCN) may
likewise suffer from a lack of speciﬁcity and
sensitivity. Nicotine is speciﬁc to tobacco but
has a short half life in plasma, and its major
metabolite, cotinine, may provide a better
guide.

The present paper addresses several issues
on estimating the human dose of ETS. In the
ﬁrst section we present data relating to the
validity of self-reports of ETS exposure and to
the choice of biochemical marker for use in
epidemiological surveys. We then document
the smoke dose received from a short-term
natural exposure, and in the ﬁnal section relate
this to blood and urinary nicotine levels
resulting from slow intravenous infusion of
small known doses of nicotine. This enables us
to reach some conclusions about the dose
received from ETS, as opposed to that received
from smoking. These studies will be published
in greater detail elsewhere.

Expression of the Transcription Factor NFATp in a Neuronal Cell
Line and in the Murine Nervous System*

(Received for publication, March 30, 1994, and in revised form, August 8, 1994)

The transcription factor NFATp, which has a central
role in cytokine gene induction in T cells, was previously
thought to be expressed only in T cells and other im-
mune cells. Here we report that NFATp is also expressed
in the rat PCIZ pheochromocytoma cell line and in the
murine nervous system. Antisera against T cell NFATp
recognize proteins of similar apparent molecular weight
in T cells, PC12 cells, and murine olfactory bulb. The
immunoreactive proteins from PC12 cells and from 01-
factory bulb bind to an NFAT site of the murine inter-
leukin-2 promoter with the same speciﬁcity as T cell
NFATp. Immunohistochemical staining localizes NFATp
to neurons, speciﬁcally to olfactory receptor neurons
and to their terminals in the olfactory bulb. The pres-
ence of NFATp in the nervous system suggests that it has
a role in the transcription of specific neuronal genes in
response to increases in cytosolic calcium.

____________-.———————

The transcription factor NFATp is essential for transcription
of cytokine genes in activated T cells (177). NFATp cooperates
with F05 and Jun family proteins in the nucleus of stimulated
T cells to activate transcription of the interleukin-2 (IL-2)‘ gene
(8—11) and acts in concert with these or other transcription fac—
tors to increase transcription of other cytokine genes (3, 4, 6, 12),
NFA’l‘p was originally identiﬁed as the “preexisting” component
of the inducible nuclear factor NFAT [8, 1.2915); its activation in
T cells depends on a calcium/calmodulin/calcineurin signaling
pathway and is sensitive to cyclosporin A and FK506 (15, 16).
NFATp is a phosphoprotein of apparent molecular mass ~120
kDa (11, 15, 17), which exists in T cells as several isoforms aris-
ing from alternatively spliced mRNA transcripts [18).

A nuclear factor similar or identical to NFATp has also been
identiﬁed in B cells (2, 1%21). Extracts ofunstimulated B cells
contain factors that bind to the distal NFAT site of the lL-2
promoter and form a complex on this site with F03 and Jun
family proteins (19). As in T cells, the activation of NFAT is
initiated by an increase in cytoplasmic calcium and is pre—
vented by treatment of the cells with cyclosporin A (20, 21).
Antisera against T cell NFATp recognize the protein—DNA com-
plexes from B cells2 and identify proteins comparable in appar<
ent molecular weight to T cell NFATp in Western analysis ofB
cell proteins.” Recent work has documented the presence of

NFA’l‘p in certain other cells of the immune system.“

There has been little reason to think that NFATp is ex-
pressed in brain or other nonlymphoid tissues. Electrophoretic
mobility shift assays did not detect proteins that bind to an
NFAT oligonucleotide in brain or liver extracts [22). In trans-
genic mice, expression of a reporter gene under control of a
multimer of the NFAT site was restricted almost entirely to
activated T cells and B cells and was not apparent in brain (22),
On the other hand the components of the Culciuxn’calmodulin/
calcineurin pathway that activates NFATp in T cells are abun-
dantly expressed in the brain [23, 24). Likewise, Fos, Jun, and
other transcription factors that combine with NFA'l‘p in T cells
are induced in neural cells by growth factors and other physi»
olog‘ical stimuli (25—29).

Here we have reexamined the possibility that NFATp is ex—
pressed in neural cells. We present evidence that NFATp is
expressed by the P012 cell line, a rat adrenal chromaﬂin tumor
cell line (30) that has been used in studies of intracellular
signaling, transcriptional regulation, and neuronal differentia-
tion. Further, we demonstrate that NFATp is present at rela-
tively high levels in the murine olfactory bulb, largely in ter»
minals ofolfactory receptor neurons, and may be expressed at
lower levels in certain other regions ofthe murinc central nerv-
ous system,

hLA'l'ERIALS AND METHODS

Cell CulturchClz cells were maintained in L15CO‘2 medium with
7% horse serum, 7% fetal calfserum. and other additives as described
(31). Murine T cell clones Ar-5 and CLTWZ were grown as described
(32).

AntiseragThe principal antiserum used in these experiments was
afﬁnity-purified antiserum against peptide 67,1 (AISSPSGLAYPDDV‘
LDYGL), a sequence located near the N terminus of murine NFATp.
Antiserum was produced by immunization of rabbits With the peptide
conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and was puriﬁed by afﬁnity
chromatography on a resin (AfﬁrGel 10, BioARad) bearing immobilized
peptide 67.1. Other reagents used were antisera against the peptides
67.2 and 72 (18} and an antiserum directed against a recombinant frag»
ment ofNFATp that includes the DNA-binding domain [18). Horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit-IgG (li‘lab’)2 fragment) was from
Cappel; Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit-lgG was from Jackson
ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc ; and normal rabbit lg (Pentax rab-
bit gamma globulins, fraction II) was from Miles Laboratories.

Viirious pathways have been postuliued for nicotine degrada-
tion involving an initial attack at either the pyridine or the
pyrrolidine rings. The evidence for the suggested pathways has
been provided mainly by the isolation hf a variety of compounds
from bacterial growth media (I. 2). tobacco seed infusions (3),
tcrnsiznted tobacco leaves (4), and the urine of animals that
previously had been fed nicotine (5, 6). Unfortunately, because
of the complexity of thme systems it. is not certain whether the
isolated products are directly or indirectly derived from nicotine,
nor is the sequence of their appearance clearly established. In}
an eﬁort to avoid the diliiculties inherent in the use of complex
systems. studies of nicotine metabolism were attempted at the
enzyme level employing crude and fractionated extracts derived

from a bacterium.

Introduction

' ' symposium here at the University of Kentucky when appropriations for
tobacco and health research had been received from the U. S. Depart-
ment of Agriculture- Among the presentations made at that time were
several by members ‘ar the‘Uhivusity faculty and szeriment Station
staff, who prouded a very considerabie parade or” talent. I especiaii‘y
remember being impressed by the potentials for modifying the chemical
and physical properties of tobacco by means of genetic manipulations, ;
variations in cultural conditions and by ' alterations in processing
methods. The repetitive plea of these scientists was “If the investiga-
tors of health problems can tell us how they want tobacco altered to
make it “safer for smoking in the form of cigaretts; we are quite
conﬁdent of being able to accomplish the changes desired." ‘ ,

There was, however, no answer given to this question. The ,

geneticists, biochemists. agronomists. and processing experts were
compelled to retire without having been given any clear health-related
goals toward which to target their investigations.

Chromosome Rearrangements and DNA Repair
Preliminary Proposal
George Weinstock, Ph.D.

Summary

Research in my laboratory has been concerned with DNA repair and
recombination. For the past several years we have been studying unequal crossing
over (UCO) or ectopic recombination. UCO is the recombination that occurs
between repeated sequences that align out of register with the rest of the
chromosome. This type of recombination leads to chromosome rearrangements
such as duplications, deletions, inversions and translocations. Moreover, UCO is
stimulated by DNA damage. The purpose of the proposed research is to:

1 Continue studies in E. coli to understand the mechanism of UCO and develop
an assay for UCO that will allow us to investigate this phenomena in all
organisms.

2. Use this assay to investigate UCO in eukaryotic cells and determine the effect of
DNA damaging treatments, DNA repair systems, ageing, and other factors.

Background

UCO is recombination between repeated sequences that gives rise to
duplications, deletions, inversions, and chromosome translocations. In man these
types of rearrangements are associated with a variety of diseases. On the X
chromosome alone, examples of diseases resulting from rearrangements causing
deletions are Kallmann syndrome, Aicardi syndrome, Goltz syndrome, X-linked
xeroderma pigmentosum. An example of a duplication and a deletion that occur
between the same repeated sequences is Charcot—Marie—Tooth disease, caused by the
duplication, and HNPP syndrome, in which case the same region is deleted. There
are, of course, other examples of less severe diseases that are caused by
rearrangements on the X chromosome, perhaps most notable being the variations
in color vision caused by recombination between tandemly repeated opsin genes.
The effects on color discrimination point out another consequence of UCO; namely
that hybrid sequences are formed. In the case of color vision, recombination
between these slightly different opsin genes leads to new hybrid genes with altered
spectral sensitivities. In addition, numerous examples of rearrangements on the
other human chromosomes have been related to disease. It is anticipated that many
human disorders will be ultimately related to these types of chromosome
rearrangements. Thus, understanding the mechanism by which rearrangements
occur and developing more sensitive assays for detecting rearrangements is
important to the molecular medicine of the future.

Our laboratory has studied UCO in E. coli. Our use of this bacteria as a model

system was mainly prompted by its ease of genetic manipulation. However, UCO is
also important in bacterial pathogenesis. For example, Vibrz'o cholera amplifies the

MOLECULAR MIMICRY BETHEEN Fc GAMMA RECEPTOR AND MOUSE HEPATITIS VIRUS PEPLDMER PROTEIN

background. Molecular mimicry is defined as the presence of epitopes, either linear
or conformational, shared between viral and host antigens (1) and may play a role in the
pathogenesis of viral infections and the induction of autoimmune diseases. Several homolo—
gous peptides between human myelin basic protein (MBP) and viral proteins have been identi—
fied including adenovirus, influenza, measles, canine distemper and Epstein-Barr viruses(2).
Molecular mimicry of a peptide comprised of 8 amino acids of MBP by Hepatitis B polymerase
(HBP) can cause autoimmune disease (3). Rabbits injected with this octapeptide developed
experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE)(3). We have demonstrated (4,5) molecular
mimicry between Fc gamma receptor (chR) and the peplomer protein S (formerly E2) of the
Mouse Hepatitis Virus (MHV).

MHV strain JHM (MHV-JHM), a member of the Coronavirus family, experimentally produces
several diseases in mice and rats, depending on the dose and route of inoculation and the
age and strain of the infected animals (7-10), MHV-JHM is highly neurotropic (6).Infection
of susceptible mice causes fatal encephalomyelitis characterized by destruction of CNS
neurons with prominent demyelination. Mice surviving encephalitis (5-10% of those infected)
subsequently develop a persistent, demyelinating disease. The virus was found to persist
in the nervous system and the demyelinating process is associated with primary infection
of oligodendrocytes (7). However, a relapsing—remitting demyelinating disease, reminiscent
of multiple sclerosis has been reported (8). Furthermore, infection of rats or mice with
MHV-JHM results in lymphocyte sensitization against MBP (9). Adoptive transfer of these
lymphocytes after in vitro restimulation with MBP results in EAE. These results suggest
that during MHV infection primary demyelination occurs by direct lysis of oligodendrocytes
followed by induction of autoimmune response. Thus, this virus provides an excellent system
for the study of the molecular basis of virus-induced demyelinating disease.

Both humoral and cellular immune responses have been implicated in protection from MHV
infection. Anti-MHV-JHM antibodies prevent death from MHV-JHM infection, but they do not
suppress viral replication in CNS (10,11). Furthermore, in the presence of antibodies MHV—
JHM replicates mainly in oligodendrocytes but not in neurons (10). Delayed—type hypersensi—
tivity l cell clones also protects mice against lethal infection with MHV—JHM although, in
agreement with the findings with antibodies, they do not inhibit virus replication in CNS
(12). Additionally, cytotoxic T cells (13), cytolytic B cells (14,15) and NK cells (16)
exhibit cytotoxic activity against MHV-JHM-infected cells. Recently, it has been reported
that clearance of MHV-JHM from CNS requires both CD4’ and CDS+ cells (17).

The S peplomer protein is encoded by MHV mRNA 3 and is synthesized on ribosomes (18.19)
as an 120 kD polypeptide.1t is cotranslationally glycosylated to a 150 kD S precursor which
is subsequently further glycosylated to the 180 kD species. Two forms of the 5 protein are
present on the surface of the virion, the 180 kD and its two non-identical cleaved products
90A kD and 908 kD. S is responsible for attachment of the virus to the host cell, MHV-
induced cell fusion, and for eliciting neutralizing antibodies (20,21).Therefore, the
peplomei‘ S protein plays a central role in the (outcome of MHV infections. We have
demonstrated molecular mimicry between Fc1R and the peplomer protein S of NHV (4,5).

Infection with herpes virus (HSV-l) resulted in the expression on the cell surface of
molecules with Fc binding ability (22,23). The 196 Fc-binding receptors induced by HSV-l
are formed by a complex of viral glycoproteins 9E and 91 (g70). Recently it has been
reported (24) that HSV-l FcR has a novel function: it participates in antibody bipolar
bridging. This has been described as the binding of a single anti—viral IgG molecule by its
Fab end to a viral epitope and by its Fc end to an Fc receptor. [t was demonstrated (24)
that bipolar bridging of immune lgG protects the virus from antibody and complement-
dependent neutralization and, therefore, offers a survival advantage to the virus.

In the present study it was shown that marked lesions indicative
for atherosclerosis can be produced within 8 weeks by feeding
rabbits a casein-rich diet supplemented with cholesterol. This is
in accordance with similar studies, in which commercial or semi—
purified diets were supplemented with 5 to 50 grams cholesterol/
kilogram diet (e. 9. Goto et al., 1974, Rosnowska et al., 1978 and
Renaud et al., 1979). The serum cholesterol concentration obtained
during the treatment period was markedly increased, but an unequi—
vocal correlation between the cumulated cholesterol intake and the
cholesterol serum concentration was not observed. In contrary the
extent of fatty streaks in part 1 was numerically smaller than in
part 2, the serum cholesterol concentration, however, was higher in
part 1 than in part 2. This discrepancy shows, that the serum

cholesterol 1evel.cannot be used for a prediction of atherogenic
lesions in the aorta.

The major parameter for the quantification of atherogenic lesions
in this study was the occurence and the extent of fatty streaks in
the thoracic (b) and the abdominal aorta of the rabbits. The term
fatty streaks is used as a preliminary description of the athero-
genic lesions observed. The histopathological description will be
obtained after the histological examination of the acrta, which

Abstract

We recently reported that the pineal hormone melatonin protected neuronal cultures from excuotoxic'ity mediated \'|.l
kainate-sensitivc glutamate receptors and from oxidative stress-induced apoptosis. It has been shown that in rats. a SySllec'
administration of kainatc induces apoptotic cell death in various brain regions, In this study. we assayed the extent of brain injury
after intraperitoneal tip.) administration of 10 mtg/kg kainate to rats, using the quantitative TUNEL technique and Nissl staining
We examined the role of melatonin on kuinate-induced brain injury by (a) injecting melatonin (4 x 2.5 mg/kg i.p.] prior to and
after ktiinatte injection and (b) injecting kainate at the time of low circulating melatonin le\els (daylight). and high melatonin
levels [nightfdurkt The extent of kainate—triggered DNA damage and the loss of Nissl staining \verc lower in animals treated with
melatonin. or when kainate was injected at night, i.e. in the presence of high endogenous levels of melatonin. Our results suggest
that both the pharmacological use of melatonin and the circadian secretion of endogenous melatonin during the night may reduce
the extent of excitotoxic brain injury. Further studies are needed to fully characterize the relevance of our ﬁndings for the
treatment of progressive neurodegenerative processes which involve excitotoxicity and opoptotic neuronal death.

Molecular characterization of the signal for radiation-inducible genes and the isolation of
novel radiation-inducible genes in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae:

Michael Fasullo, PhD. Loyola University

Specific Aims:

Damage-inducible (DIN) genes have been cloned and characterized from many
organisims, including yeast, bacteria, and man. Many of these genes are induced by a variety
of DNA damaging agents that inﬂict a diverse spectrum of DNA lesions, including base pair
damage, cross-links, bulky adducts, and single- and double-strand breaks. These DNA
damaging agents include chemicals that cause oxidative damage via the formation of free
radicals, similar to those found in tobacco smoke. The diversity of DNA lesions caused by
free radicals provokes the question of whether all these lesions can serve as the primary
signal for damage—induction or whether these lesions are processed to a common signal that
triggers the induction of DIN genes. The aim of this project is to focus specifically at
ionizing radiation as an agent that induces DIN genes in yeast, to elucidate the genetic
pathway by which a single double-strand break may serve as a signal for the induction of
such genes, and to isolate novel radiation-inducible genes that may be triggered directly by
the presence of DNA double—strand breaks. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been
chosen for these experiments becuase many genes involved in the repair of radiation damage
are well defined and the molecular biology and genetics to address the phenotypes of
mutated genes is well advanced. In addition, roughly 1% of the yeast genome is speculated
to encode damage-inducible genes (Ruby and Szostak, 1985), only a few yeast genes have
been characterized as damage-inducible, and previous attempts to isolate DIN genes have
not utilized ionizing radiation as the DNA damaging agent.-

Significance:

Human genes that are induced by ionizing radiation include TNFa, p53 , protein
kinase C, IL-1, collagenase and gadd45 (growth grrest and QNAgamage). These and other
characterized genes represent a subset of a theoretically much larger set of genes (for review
see Fornace, 1992). Although the functional significance of the DIN genes has yet to be
explained, recent evidence has found that failure to induce gadd45 is correlated with
radiosensitivity in patients afﬂicted with Ataxia telangiectasia, and such patients have a
higher incidence of cancer, especially lymphomas. The induction of these genes by ionizing
radiation and free radicals may occur by a variety of signal transducing mechanisms.
Oxidative damage to membranes may trigger the expression of protein kinase C which
phophorylates transcription factors, such as jun, that in turn induce the expression of such
genes (Hallahan et al., 1991), although this may not be the mechanism of the induction of
gadd45. Alternatively, DNA damage may be the primary signal for the induction of damage-
inducible genes. This is suggested by the observation that cell lines that are defective in
damage repair have higher levels of the expression of particular damage-inducible genes
(Herrlich et al., 1992). Nonetheless, the signal transduction mechanism which is provoked
by a DNA lesion is poorly understood.

Elucidation of the pathway by which radiation-induced DNA lesions directly stimulate
DIN genes may be better addressed in yeast. This proposal is divided into the following
sections. First, elucidation of the mechanism by which a single double-strand break can

1) $309513 of Current Research:
There are many drugs of abuse, each of which has a distinctive pharmacology. For example,

stimulant drugs (e.g., amphetamine and caffeine) and depressant drugs (e.g., alcohol and
barbiturates) differ in their subjective effects, but both types of drugs are abused. It has been
demonstrated in animal studies that certain brain areas play relatively more important roles in the
development and maintenance of behaviors related to the rewarding properties of drugs of abuse.
Two important pathways are the mesolimbic and mesocortical dopamine pathways, which emerge
from the ventral tegmental area of Tsai (VT A). Projection of the neurons of the VTA to the nucleus
accumbens (mesolimbic) and to the prefrontal cortex (mesocortical) appear to be important for the
expression of the rewarding properties of a wide variety of drugs of abuse. Most drugs of abuse
increase neurotransmission through the mesolimbic-mesocortical sytems, eitherby increasing activity
of VTA neurons (e.g., nicotine, opiates, ethanol) or by augmenting the release of dopamine in the
terminal areas (e.g., cocaine and amphetamine). Because the VTA is one important area for the
mediation of drug-induced reward, the study of how various abused substances affect neurons of
the VTA is a critical for the treatment of addiction.

The overall goal of my research is to develop a better understanding of the physiology and
pharmacology of central reward systems. In order to approach this goal, I have developed a brain
slice preparation of the VTA suitable for intra- and extracellular recording. Putative dopamine~
containing neurons of the mesencephalon have been well characterized electrophysiologically lit
v_iy9; neurons in the brain slice appear similar to neurons studied in vivo. VTA neurons fire
spontaneouslyin a slow (0.5 - 5 Hz), regular pattern. We have examined the effects of several drugs
of abuse on this spontaneous activity. Among the agents we have examined are cocaine (Brodie
and Dunwiddie, 1990) and ethyl alcohol (Brodie, et al., 1990). We are continuing our study of
ethanol, by using intracellular recording in an attempt to determine the mechanism of action of
ethanol-induced excitation of VTA neurons. Ethanol appears to cause a slight depolarization, a
decrease in the action potential amplitude, and a decrease in the amplitude of the
afterhyperpolarization (Brodie and Shefner, 1989). Further experiments are planned to determine
whether any of these effects underlies the ethanol-induced excitation of VTA neurons.

We have also investigated the effects of nicotine on the spontaneous activity of VTA neurons
GBrodie, 1991). Nicotine excites VTA neurons in a concenu’ation-dependent manner. VTA neurons
possess an EC50 for nicotine-induced excitation of about 250 nM; therefore, VTA neurons are more
sensitive to the excitatory effects of nicotine than many other central neurons. Furthermore, little
desensitization to the effects of nicotine are seen at lower concentrations (less than 1 pM) (Brodie,
1991). The response of VTA neurons to nicotine is blocked by hexamethonium or mecamylamine.
VTA neurons also possess pirenzepine-sensitive muscarinic cholinergic receptors (Brodie and
Mueller, 1988; Lacey, et a1, 1988), so studies of nicotinic cholinergic receptors must be performed
with speciﬁc nicotinic agonists, and/or in the presence of muscarinic cholinergic antagonists. With
our preparation, a full range of concentrations of nicotine can be applied to the same VTA neuron,
which would permit a more precise characterization of the speciﬁc receptor subtype involved in
mediating nicotine-induced excitation of VTA neurons.

2) Research Plan and Goals of Proposed Research
Molecular biologists have identified a number of different subtypes of the nicotinic

cholinergic receptor. It is known that the nicotinic cholinergic receptor is a pentamer formed from
4 subunits: 2 a subunits, and one each of B, y (or a) and 6. Recent studies from a number of
laboratories indicate that pharmacological specificity is conferred by the at and [5 subunits. Five
forms of the a subunit («2 - a6) and four forms of the [1 subunit (p2 - [15) are found in rat brain.
Different combinations of the various forms of these subunits constitute functionally different

that vpr transfected into a rhabdomyosarcoma cell line can induce its differentiation. Thus, vpr may cause a
disruption of the carefully regulated and coordinated processes of proliferation and differentiation that
occurs during the development of progenitor cells into mature and functional progeny. A disruption in the
function of stroma cells may similarly be affected by the activity of the vpr gene.

In their paper on HIV induction of rhabdomyosarcoma muscle cell line differentiation, Levi and cot
workers showed that HIV expression leads to inhibition of the muscle cell’s proliferation and the activation of
the dormant endogenous differentiation program. The effect was mediated by the regulatory vpr gene of the
virus with its protein acting as a regulator of cell function. In discussing the implications of these findings.
the authors speculate that "stem cell populations (e.g., skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle. hematopoietic pre-
cursors) are disrupted by vpr and lose the ability to replenish tissues, leading to a gradual decline of mature
effector population.“ Since some viruses can activate cellular genes in a variety of cells, it is reasonable to
examine whether HIV regulatory genes can induce changes in the normal pattern of gene expression in
hematopoietic progenitor cells and the accessory cell function of stroma cells, Such an approach may provide
evidence for the dysregulation of proliferation and differentiation as a mechanism of bone marrow suppress
ion. The authors also postulate that “cells that are subject to abortive infection, owing to an inability of the
cells to support virus replication, nevertheless might be dysregulated by the activities of vpr." Thus, non-
productively infected cells of tissues that are not the usual targets of HIV in vivo, but are afflicted in AIDS
patients, may be dysregulated in the absence of reverse transcription, integration, or residual viral nucleic
acid. This may explain the consistent lack of evidence for a direct effect on progenitor cells in in vivo studies
while in vitro experiments demonstrate that progenitor cells can be infected by HIV and their growth
impaired. Though replication of the virus is, perhaps dogmatically, the yardstick by which a cell‘s tropism
for HIV is measured, it is possible that abortive infection of a cell that is not the usual target of the virus can
still alter the function of that cell. In this context, the marked suppression of progenitor cell growth in
vitro following infection by hepatitis B virus correlates with only a transient replication of the virus in
bone marrow cultures. We postulate, therefore, that while bone marrow progenitor cells or stroma cells
may not be the primary target cell of HIV in situ, abortive infection may still have negative consequences on
thdrdevdopmentandfuncﬁon

Our first aim is to determine whether the vpr gene of HIV is responsible for the suppression of
hematopoietic progenitor cells. The mouse embryonic stem cell (ES) is a totipotential cell line that has the
capacity to develop into every tissue type when injected into host blastocysts. As such, it has become a
valuable tool in the study of hematopoiesis and its molecular biology, and so will be used as a developmental
model of hematopoiesis in these studies. Several characteristics of ES cells make it a good model to define the
role of vpr (and other regulatory genes) in stem cell suppression, and a good substitute for primary bone
marrow derived CD34+ cells whose use in similar studies may be technically more difficult. Since ES cells
are a pure population of truly totipotential cells, they can be used to gain insight into the biological
significance of novel genes, and dissect the molecular processes that occur during the early events of
connnhmenn sentenewaL and dhmrenhaﬁon of henmtopomnc progenhor ceHs. Funnermore,in vnm
techniques have been developed to study hematopoietic cell differentiation in ES cells, and the profile and
pattern of genes activated during this process have been characterized and are consistent and reproducible.
Thus, the expression of genes involved in the early stages of hematopoiesis precede those required for the
terminal stages of differentiation, Alterations in the normal process of differentiation is reflected in a
distorted profile of gene expression. These observations are relevant to the proposed study, Finally, based
on our studies on studies of the vav proto-oncogene, genes of particular interest can be readily and stably

function of most eukaryotic cells. A basic aspect of this
polarity is that the cell’s plasma membrane is divided
into discrete domains Examples include the membranes of
axons and dendrites in neurons, the growing bud and mating
projection in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and lamel—
lipodia in ﬁbroblasts. However, the best—studied type of
polarity is found in epithelia, which is the most common type
of tissue in animals (52, 56). In simple epithelia the cells
form a monolayer where one surface of the cell—the
apical—faces the outside world or a topologically equivalent
space, such as the lumen of the intestines. This is separated
by tight junctions from the basolateral surface, which con-
tacts adjacent cells and the underlying connective tissue.
Apical and basolateral surfaces have very diﬂerent protein
and lipid compositions (4, 10, 57). For example, the
basolateral surface contains receptors for adhering to other
cells and the basement membrane, and for uptake of
nutrients from the circulation. The apical surface contains
transporters for exchanging small molecules with the outside
world. As epithelial cells divide and differentiate they must
send proteins to the correct surface to establish their polarity
(25), Moreover, in a differentiated epithelial cell, polarity is
maintained despite an enormous ﬂux of membrane compo-
nents traveling to and from each surface.

S PA TIA L asymmetry is fundamental to the structure and

Pathways to the Cell Surface

As shown in Fig. 1, epithelial cells use two pathways to send
proteins to the correct surface. Newly made proteins can
travel directly from the trans-Golgi network (TGN)' to ei
that the apical or basolateral surface. Alternatively, proteins
can use an indirect pathway traveling ﬁrst from the TGN to
the basolateral surface, followed by endocytosis and trans»
cytosis to the apical surface (46, 55). The former pathway
was discovered in MDCK cells which form a well-polarized
monolayer when cultured on a permeable support. In pio—
neering work, Rodriguez-Boulan and Sabatini (53) showed
that inﬂuenza virus buds solely from the apical surface,

whereas vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) buds from the
basolateral surface (53). Viral envelope proteins, hemagglu-
tinin (HA) of inﬂuenza and G protein of VSV (VSVG), travel
through the secretory pathway together to the trans-Golgi
network (TGN). Here they are packaged into separate vesi-
cles that carry these proteins to the apical and basolateral
surfaces, respectively (24, 51). Newly made endogenous
MDCK proteins are also delivered directly from the TGN to
their ﬁnal destination (33). Hepatocytes, in contrast, lack
a pathway from the TGN to the apical (canalicular) surface
and rely entirely on the indirect, transcytotic route (3). The
cntcroeyte—like CaCo-Z cell line uses a mixture of the direct
and transcytotic strategies (32, 42). For several apical pro-
teins a fraction is delivered directly from the TGN to the api-
cal surface, while the balance follows the transcytotic route.
MDCK cells can also use the transcytotic route, as was
shOWn for the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR)
transfected into these cells (45), as well as for endogenous
proteins (5).

Both the cell type and the protein inﬂuence the route taken
to the apical surface. For example, dipcptidyl pcptidase IV
(DPP—IV) and aminopeptidasc N (APN) use the transcytotic
route in liver and both routes in CaCoZ cells. When trans-
fected into MDCK cells, they mainly use the direct route
from the TGN to the apical surface (39, 66). However, about
20% of both travel to the MDCK basolateral surface. In the
case of APN, this wasjudged to be a non-transcytosing pool,
although transcytosis was evaluated indirectly (66). If true,
this would imply that in MDCK cells, basolateral APN is un—
able to be transcytoscd and that transcytosis depends on the
cell type. In contrast, we found that the 20% of DPP—IV
reaching the basolateral surface is then transcytosed (11).
The fraction of DPP—IV going to the basolateral surface
varies with the cell type, but it is transcytosed eﬂiciently in
all cells (40). In contrast the pIgR exclusively uses the trans
cytotic route regardless of the cell type.

Whereas the TGN to apical pathway is present only in cer-
tain cells, transcytosis is found in all epithelial cells exam-
ined The importance of transcytotic sorting is emphasized
by the fact that while roughly 5 % of the cell surface is newly
made per hour, the equivalent of about 50% of the cell sur-
face is cndocytosed per hour (63). Most cndocytosed pro-
teins simply recycle, but without exquisite selectivity for en-
try into the transcytotic pathway, the two surfaces of the cell
would be rapidly scrambled.

The amount of a protein at a surface depends on the rates

of delivery and removal due to endocytosis and/or degrada-

Complexes of Res-GTP with Raf-1 and
Mitogen—Activated Protein Kinase Kinase

Shonna A. Moodie.* Berthe M. Willumsen, Michael J. Weber,
Alan Wolfman

The guanosine triphosphate (GTP)vbinding protein Rae functions in regulating growth and
differentiation; however, little is known about the protein interactions that bring about its
biological activity. Wild-type Ras or mutant terms of Ftas were covalently attached to an
insoluble matrix and then used to examine the interaction of signaling proteins with Ftas.
Forms of Ras activated either by mutation (Gly12Val) or by binding of the GTP analog.
guanylyI-imidodiphosphate (GMP-PNP) interacted speciﬁcally with Raf-1 whereas an et-
fector domain mutant. lle36Ala. failed to interact with Fiat-1. Mitogen-activated protein
kinase (MAP kinase) activity was only associated with activated forms of Ras. The specific
interaction of actiVated Has with active MAP kinase kinase (MAPKK) was confirmed by
direct assays. Thus the forming of complexes containing MAPKK activity and Raf-1 protein

are dependent upon the activity of Ftas.

 

The majority of cellular Ras in quiescent
cells is in the inactive guanosinc diphos—
phate (GDP)—bound conformation. Stimu-
lation of cells with mitogens or differentia‘
tion factors increases the abundance of the
active GTP-bound form of Res (1), The
activity of R35 is required for regulatory
signaling by plasma membrane tyrosine ki-
nase oncogenes and receptors (2) . Blocking
the action of Ras, either by microinjection
of antibodies or through the expression of a
dominant negative mutant, prevents the
activation of the cytosolic serine-threonine
protein kinases Raf-1 and MAP kinase (3,
4). The expression of activated Ras, either
in whole cells or in vitro activates these
cytosolic setinc-threoninc protein kinases

tion as part of a kinase cascade, in which
MAP kinases are activated by a MAPKK
(8), which in turn can be phosphorylated
and activated by the Raf-1 protein kinasc
(9). The components of this pathway may

ever, because neither Ras or Raf-1 activates
MAP kinascs in Ratla cells (10).

Though it is clear that Ras participates
in signaling between the cell membrane
and the cytosol. the biochemical interac-
tions that mediate the action of Ras are
poorly understood. To determine if Ras
might physically interact with cytosolic
signaling components in a GTP-depen-
dent manner, we covalently bound recom
binant c-Ha-Ras (referred to as Ras) to
silica beads activated by an N-hydroxyl
succinimide group (11, l2). The coupled
Ras was active in binding guanine nuclei
oticles and has been used to examine
interactions between Ras and neuroﬁbro-
min, a regulator of Ras function (12). The
immobilized Ras was used to probe rat
brain cytosol for signaling proteins that

speciﬁcally interacted with Ras-GTP.
Immobilized Ras bound to GMP-PNP (aj'
nonhydrolyzable GTP analog) formed a sta~
ble complex with Raf-1 (Fig. 1A). Approx-
imately 15% of the total cytosolic Raf—1

10% as effective as wild-type Ras in forming
stable complexes with Raf—1 (Fig. 1A). An

even smaller amount of Raf-l associated
with the GDP-bound form of Rasvam. A
formof Res with a mutation in the effector
domain, RasAlaJé, bound to either GDP or
GMP-PNP failed to bind detectable
amounts of Raf-1 (Fig. 1B). Thus, the stable
association of Raf-l with immobilized Ras
correlated well with the formation of the
active GTP-bound form of Ras.

We investigated the GTP-dependent as-
sociation of Ras with MAPKK and MAP
kinase, which have been reported to func~

proved absorbents for hydrogen cyanide.

The invention is a class of absorbents for HCN for
use in cigaret filters and other applications where selec-
tivity is desired, comprising amine complexes of certain
heavy metal salts, particularly the complexes of cuprous
salts, carried on solid substrates.

For selective removal of HCN from cigaret smoke various
filter compositions have been proposed. Alkaline additives
such as alkali metal carbonates and the like have been ap-
plied to conventional filter materials. Activated carbon or
charcoal with a surface treatment of copper salt converted
by heat to the oxide have been tried. Keith et al, U. S.
#3,251,365 discloses iron and zinc oxides on high—area car-
riers. Horsewell et al, U. S. #3,550,600 employs zinc
acetate as absorbent,made alkaline with certain bases such as
polyethylenimine, triethanolamine, sodium acetate, or borax.
These compositions have some effectiveness in removing HCN
preferentially. The best results reported Show 50 to 85%

removal of HCN. Moreover, the activated carbon types remove
significant proportions of other gas phase smoke components,

so that there is an effect on flavor of the smoke stream.

The present inventors have discovered that it is
possible to remove 90% to 100% of the HCN from smoke, by the
proper choice of absorbent quantity, substrate, and condi-
tions as will be described in detail below. At least certain
of these absorbents have been shown to be relatively harmless
and non—toxic. They are easily prepared and quite inexpensive.

The substrate for the complex should be a solid having
a surface area of at least one square meter per gram and
preferably much larger. A particularly effective support will
be discussed below. The complex compound may be applied to
this from solution (perhaps 0.2% to 5% concentration) in a
volatile solvent, such as alcohol, and the solvent evaporated.
Other familiar methods of applying or distributing the absor-
bent may be used. The absorbent/support is then made a part
of the cigaret filter so that the smoke will have intimate
contact with it. If the support is granular, this may be done
by filling a space in a filter plug with the material so as to

Hepatitis A: antibodies are
but illness is not

prevalent

Research on hepatitis A may lag behind that on
hepatitis 3. but a clinical picture of type A disease it
becoming more clear.

The words “subclinical picture" might be more
accurate. hon-ever. because according to Jules 1.. Dim-
stag. MD. and coworkers. much of the disease
produced by the hepatitis A virus is not clinically
apparent. They suggest it is this sporadic. inapparent
infection that maintains the hepatitis A virus in
nature between major detectable outbreaks

Recently in New York City. in urological testing of
more than 1.000 specimens. this research team found
antibodies to hepatitis A virus in 01% of middle class
volunteer blood donors and in 609‘. oi poor persons
from the inner city. Despite this prevalence. less than
592 of these people could remember having had hepa-
titis. The investigators say this is "consistent With the
belief that most cases are clinically inapparent "

Even when hepatitis A is clinically apparent. Dr
Dienstag told an American College of Physicians
audience in Boston. usually it is a mild. self-limited
illness. Hepatic encephalopathy develops in a [eu-
patients. but. in the outbreaks that Di Dienstag and
colleagues have studied. all patients have survived
Thus. he said. evidence trout these and other studies
suggests that hepatitis A rarely tulminates. and the
virus so far has not been associated ser'ologically with
chronic liver disease.

Until recently. he says. most of what was known
about the epidemiology of hepatitis A was learned
from studies with volunteers and observations during
natural outbreaks. Now that the hepatitis A virus has
been identiﬁed and its antibody can be detected by
immune adherence hemagglutination. radioimrnu-
noaaaay. complement fixation. and immune electron
microscopy. "the means are at hand to test and extend
our current understanding of this virus "

The virus contains RNA. Dr Dienstag pointed out.
and it is "most likely an enterovirus“ of the icosahedral
picorna group. "although a few properties don't fit "

He and his colleagues report that exposure to hepa~
titis A virus is much more likely than exposure to the
type B virus. A two to six times greater prevalence oi
antibodies to type A than to type B has been found in
most populations studied in the l‘nited States and lor
both sexes The likelihood of exposure increases with
the person's age. decreases with rising socioeconomic
class. and varies from country to country in relation
to their stages of development. emphasis on aanita~

tion. and perhaps some still-undiscovered geographic
factors.

With regard to age. the prevalence of antibodies to
hepatitis A virus increases with age in all socioeco-
nomic groups tested. approaching 80?: among persons
50 or older. It is possible that these older people were
exposed to the virus years ago when living conditions
were less hygienic. Support for this idea is found in
the declining number of reported childhood cases of
hepatitis A in this country in recent years. However.
anti-hepatitis A titers in immune serum globulin
collected in large cities like Boston in the last 30 years
have not shown a similar decline.

Another possibility is that. at least in urban areas.
there may be continuous exposure throughout life At
least half the people living in the lower socioeconomic
areas of New York appear to become inlet-ted by the
time they reach their 205. But in neighborhoods where
people of a higher socioeconomic class live. serological
testing by age groups has to extend to people in their
dill and 505 before a 50% rate of exposure is
reached.

Say Dr Dienslag and colleagues "One implication
of these seroepidemiologic studies is the advisability
of preparing immune serum globulin from plasma of
older. lower socioeconomic class urban individuals "

The inverse relationship of exposure to hepatitis A
virus and socioeconomic class has been reported by
several investigators and holds "whether social—m.
nomic class is defined by level of education. religious
group. working class or prison status. census classifi-
cation. or underdeveloped vs developed country "

SCRANTON, PA 18510
U.S.A.

lg vitro lipid peroxidation of red blood cells has been studied
using high glucose (55.5 mM) in the media to stimulate lipid
peroxidation. Vitamins A, C and E in a natural matrix and a
citrus extract reduced lipid peroxidation as measured by
thiobarbituric acid reactivity. A human supplementation study
was done in which it was shown that natural vitamin C containing
ascorbic acid and citrus extract significantly elevated lipid
peroxidation in both plasma and urine. Citrus extract alone
decreased plasma lipid peroxidation. Natural vitamin A and E
decreased both plasma and urine lipid peroxidation. A

combination of natural vitamins A, E and citrus extract was the

most effective supplement resulting in more than a 30% decrease
in both plasma and urine lipid peroxidation.

INTRODUCTION

Oxygen, though necessary for life, is a toxic substance.
Fortunately, 98% of the oxygen is completely reduced to water in
the process of respiration. The other 2% turns into potentially
toxic free radical oxidantsl. These substances can damage
proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and polyunsaturated fatty
acids. They can also directly reduce the level of the antioxidant
defense molecules in the plasmaz. Free radical-mediated lipid
peroxidation has been implicated in several disease states
including cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, postischemic

reoxygenation injury, as well as in the degenerative processes

Changes in Smoking Characteristics by Type of
Employment From 1970 to 1979/80
{at 2W"

James J. weinkam, DSc, and Theodor D. Sterling, PhD

 

Changes in the distribution of smoking status between and within occupations by sex.
race, and age are examined for 1970 and 1979/30, 10 years that saw rapid changes in
smoking prevalence. The pattern of econpation within smoking categories remains
basically unchanged, and, in fact, becomes more pronounced among males. The proba»
bility of young people taking up smoking remains tied to eventual occupational choice.
The decline in smoking prevalence is larger among the employed than among those who

are not employed. There has been a substantial increase in refusals to answer questions
about smoking.

Key words: occupation, smoking prevalence, smoking decline

 

INTRODUCTION

There have been a number of reports on prevalence of smoking by occupation.
based largely on data collected prior to 1971 [Sterling and Weinkam, 1976, 1978;
Covey and Wynder, 1981; Blair et al, 1985]. However, profound changes have taken
place since then that may have affected both the mix of occupations and the prevalence
of smoking of the U.S. population. Widespread introduction of new technology may
have operated to lessen the importance of certain service jobs and to increase
technical, professional, and clerical employment. These same factors may also have
contributed to a shift in racial differences in occupation. Housewives have entered or
reentcred the labor force in increasing numbers. At the same time, there appears to
have been an overall decline in the prevalence of smoking.

Changes in smoking prevalence over time raise a number of questions of
importance to occupational health investigations:

1. Have ’hcre been changes in the occupational differences in smoking
prevalence?

2. Have there been changes in the distribution of occupations within various
smoking categories?

3. Are such changes similar for females and males, for blacks and whites?

Nested Discontinuity — Gabriel Kaufmann

NESTED DISCONTINUITY: A MODEL FOR LAGGING DNA STRAND SYNTHESIS

1. Synopsis

Three genetically distinct DNA polymerases, pols a, 6 and e,
are implicated in eucaryotic chromosome replication. Yet how
they collaborate is incompletely understood (1). According to a
model based on studies with a soluble SV40 replication system,
pol a—primase synthesizes Okazaki pieces and also initiates
replication at the origin. Leading strand elongation is delegated
to pol 6 (2-4). This model assigns no function to pol 5 nor
explains how sequence fidelity is maintained without a proof—
reading function in the lagging strand DNA polymerase.

The notion that lagging strand DNA synthesis is mediated
solely by pol a—primase has been questioned by us. We proposed
instead that an Okazaki piece arises by ligation of shorter
precursor chains and that two DNA polymerases partake in its
synthesis (5,6). According to this Nested Discontinuity Model
(ref. 6, Fig. 7), pol a-primase synthesizes RNA primers (iRNA)
and extends them with dNMPs to generate DNA primers below 40 nt.
Several DNA primers assemble then into an Okazaki piece in a
process which entails removal of iRNA, gap-filling by pol 6 or
pol e and ligation. A mature Okazaki piece joins then onto a
growing long chain. These conclusions are based on two types of
evidence: a) the ability to distinguish between synthesis of DNA
primers and their conversion into Okazaki pieces with specific
inhibitors and b) the configuration of DNA primers in replicating
DNA. Thus, pol a—specific agents such as BuPdGTP (7) and pol a-
specific monoclonal antibodies selectively inhibit DNA primer
synthesis. In contrast, COMDP, which inhibits pol 6 or pol 6
with greater potency than pol a (8,9), slows down the synthesis
of Okazaki pieces without affecting DNA primer synthesis (our
unpublished results). We have also demonstrated that DNA primers
configure on the lagging template as a contiguous— or near—
contiguous array by enzymatic manipulations of isolated
replicating SV40 DNA, using Klenow polymerase, MMTV reverse
transcriptase and T4 DNA ligase (5 and our unpublished results).

2. Outline of plans and goals of the proposed research

our goal is to test the basic tenets of the Nested
Discontinuity Model. Specific issues addressed are the order of
events in Okazaki piece assembly and the identity of enzymes
involved in these steps. Regarding the first issue We consider
two opposing scenarios. In one, DNA primers are deposited
throughout the Okazaki range prior to further processing steps of
iRNA removal, gap—filling and ligation (serial mechanism).
Alternatively, processing closely follows deposition (parallel
mechanism). We also ask what are the polarities of deposition
and processing. Our unpublished results suggest a 5' to 3' order
of deposition. This would also be the order of processing in a
parallel mechanism. A serial mechanism is compatible with
processing in either polarity (see also Fig. 1). Regarding the
second issue we ask which DNA polymerase, 6 or e, catalyzes gap
filling; which DNA ligase, I or II, catlyzes DNA primer ligation
and whether the same enzyme ligates Okazaki pieces.

CAST LEAF DEVELOPMENT

A.

Obiectiv : Develop subjectively and physically acceptable recomtitutcd tobacco sheets
for domestic and international application using Cast Leaf technology and proprietary
binder systems.

Results: Cast leaf Pilot Plant - The pilot plant is still on schedule for completion by
October 11. The grinding area should be operational by December. 'Ihe'latest schedule
includes a shipping date of November 8th for the grinder and November 22nd for the
cyclone, ductwork and dust collector. The dry ribbon blender and dust feeder will be
installed in November so that we can blend dust ground off site.

 

Operator training in control screen operation and in the BL Plant is complete. The pilot
plant and laboratory Job Safe Procedures are also completed.

Cast Leaf Development - Laboratory studies with hand cast sheets have shown that the
addition of guar gum binder to prewetted tobacco in the absence of DAP produces
stronger sheets. The addition of DAP to the formulation reduces sheet strength A large
particle size guar mixed with the dry tobacco blend was also shown to improve sheet
quality. The mechanism of this phenomenon is believed to be a slower guar hydration
rate allowing better tobacco hydration to occur. Larger quantities of ﬁne and coarse guar
have been ordered for conﬁrmation of this phenomenon in the Cast Leaf Pilot Plant.

A preliminary analysis of 24% recon cigarettes indicated that the DAP content of the
recon is a major factor affecting tar and nicotine delivery, puff count, and static burn.
The recon used in this analysis included Cast Leaf Laboratory models as well as
production RLB, RLTC, and RCB which cover a wide range of sheet density.

Cadiz - Preliminary chemical analysis of the Cadiz trial products in August are
satisfactory. The bulk products are expected to be received in USA in October for
subjective and survivability assessment.

BL Plant Capacity Increase - The Richmond panel detected differences in BL produced
at higher line speeds (330 vs 350 fpm). Modiﬁcation of the dryer proﬁle moved the
subjective response closer to the control however additional trials, planned for October,

are required to qualify the linespced up.

Alternate Sheet Suppliers - Q ‘-' Differences were detected in Marlboro containing
LTR sheet substituted for RLTC at a full (6.6%) and half (3.3%) replacement. The
ﬁndings were reviewed with M. Schulz from PME Leaf. Additional trials are planned at
LTR to produce sheet with European feedstocks for evaluation in a Pan European
Marlboro.

suggested deﬁnition of "moderation". Such
changes have undoubtedly been achieved in some
groups under regular surveillance over short pc-
riods, but long-term dietary compliance in the mul-
tiple risk factor intervention trial may have been
less than intended and an earlier American study
also ran into trouble because of poor compliance
(1!). These difﬁculties are much better acknowl-
edged and grappled with than swept under the car-
pet. The possibility. at least. that moderate alcohol
consumption reduces the risk of IHD is one that
poses obvious difﬁculties. but there is no point in
pretending that it does not exist.

Thirdly, what are the advantages and disadvan-
tages of making recommendations about healthy
living in general rather than about MD in partic-
ular? It is a fair bet that losing weight is a more
immediate personal goal for most people. including
middle-aged men. than avoiding IHD. A reduction
in fat intake (along with the pursuit of physical
activity) is common to both purposes and it seems
short-sighted not to make the most of the particu-
larly strong motivation towards weight control.

Finally, the debate must certainly proceed with-

the Department‘ot' Health's advisory machinery

National Advisory Committee on Nutrition Educa-

Britain many of which are. of course. concerned
with ll-lD. Besides making s‘peciﬁc toposals. the
report apparently recognize the ifﬁculries the
food in ustry would face and consequently sug-
gested a prolonged time-scale over which changes
could be made. By all accounts, the subcommittee‘s
report was well received by the parent committee.
However. the industry apparently disliked much of
what it read and seems to have got the Department
to suppress or at any rate delay the report.’ lfso. the

- Risk factor intervention
does work

Professor Oliver uses data from the US multiple risk
factor intervention trial as evidence for his argu-
ment that mass inten-entions to reduce risk factors
have not worked and ought to be given up.

The data from this trial. in fact. show just the
opposite (1). The rates of coronary mortality were
much reduced in both groups. the halt‘ given special
interventions and the half returned to their usual
sources of medical care. The designers of the study
assumed that the risk factors among the "usual
care" group would change very little. preserving
the statistical likelihood that 187 coronary deaths
would occur among them. They calculated that a
much greater reduction in risk factors among the
"special interventions" group would reduce their
projected number or“ coronary deaths to 137. thus
providing a 27% difference that would be statisti-
cally signiﬁcant.

What then happened proved that risk factor
intervention does work. contrary to Oliver‘s inter~
ptetation. Since the American public and their phy-
stctans have so widely accepted the value of stop-

Abstract

A two heating zone pyrolysis system capable ofa heating rate of41) OC/second and a
flow rate of 70 nil/second was coupled to a rapid scanning Fourier transform infrared
spectrometer (FTIR). This fast evolved gas analysis system was applied to the study of the
simultaneous evolution of low molecular weight gas phase products, such as C0, C03, H30,
CH4, C2H4, and CHZO during the pyrolysis of cellulose, Different pyrolytie conditions, including
heating rate, gas ﬂow rate, and residence time, were tested to study their effects on the formation
of gaseous compounds during cellulose pyrolysis. ElTorts were made to achieve a well-
controlled heating environment and sample temperature measurement. Levoglucosan, a major
component oftar and a primary pyrolysis product, was also studied. Comparison ofthe pyrolysis
products from cellulose and levoglueosan showed great similarities and provided insights into the
precursors and formation mechanisms of gas phase products, This experimental method
provides not only a technique to analyze evolved gases in real time, but information on reaction

mechanisms as well as a way to distinguish and control primary and secondary reactions.

ABSTRACT

In the nematode Camw/tabditis elegam, germ cells normally adopt one o[ three fa mitosis, sperrnatt»
genesis or oogenesis. We have identiﬁed and characterized the gene [(2573, which is required for germ
cells to differentiate as sperm rather than as oocytes. Analysis of double nurttrnts suggests thatﬂygz? is
absolutely required for spermatogenesis and acts at the end of the regulatory hierarchy controlling sex
determination for the germ line. By contrast, mutations in fog-3 do not alter the sexual identity ofotlICt
tissues. \Ve also have characterized the null phenotype offag—J , another gene, required for spct’matogeuci
sis; we demonstrate that it too controls the sexual identity of germ cells but not of other tissues Finally,
we have studied the interaction of these two fog genes with gldil, a gene required for germ cells to
undergo oogenesis rather than mitosis. On the basis of these results, we propose that germfell fare
might be controlled by a set of inhibitory interactions among genes that specify one of three fines:

 

mitosis. spermatogenesis or oogenesis. Such 2r regulatory network would link the

cell {are to the suppression of the other two.

lJRINC anirnal development, the establishment of

sexual identity is crucial for the proper regulation
of many cell fates. In the nematode C, elegans, for exam-
ple, the copulatory organs, their underlying muscula-
ture, the neurons that control these muscles, the so—
matic gonad and the germ tissue all differ markedly
between the two sexes. These differences are controlled
by a common signal, the ratio of X chromosomes to
autosornes ()lAlﬂ, and HERMAN 1979). Animals with
two X chromosomes and two sets of autosomes develop
as hertrraphrot',tes, whereas animals with one Xchro-
mosonic develop as males. This X :A signal is interpre-
ted by a set of regulatory genes that establish the sexual
identity of the animal (reviewed by lIODGKIN 1990;
Vtt.t.r L'\'li anti MEYER 1990; KUWABARA and KIMBLE
1992). We are interested in how the genes that control
sexual identity specify individual cell fates. To study this
process. we are analyzing the development of the germ
line.

Several factors make the germ line of C. elegans attraci
tive for studying the regulation of cell fate First, germ
cells adopt our terminal fates, each of which can be
identiﬁed easily: in males they differentiate to form
sperm, whereas in hermaphrodites the ﬁrst germ cells
to differentiate ltrt'rn sperm, but later ones develop as
ooeytes ('HIRSH fl :1]. 1976). Second, the germ line is
the only tissue in the nematode for which new cells are

by J. DA Heck, R. s. Lake, and R. D. Leverette

The journal Science published in its October 18 issue a study by
Mikhail Denissenko and colleagues which describes EMA adduct
patterns in the P53 gene of cultured cells exposed to
benzo{a3pyrene diol epoxide {839E}. The most frequent sites for
this in Vitro adduct formation were compared to a previously—
published database which has inventoried the sites of mutation in
the PS3 gene of human tumors. Publication of the pager was
accompanied by a flurry of reports in the print and broadcast
news media which grossly overinterereted the actual findings of
the investigators. The following statement is based on our own
review of the paper and briefly references a substantial and
well-founded body of prior work in the field which supports a
very different perspective on the biological significance of
benzofa}pyrene (B[a2P) in cigarette smoke.

The P53 gene and cancer

The P53 gene’s ultimate product is a protein which normally acts
as a transcription factor that participates in the regulation of
other genes involved in a variety of fundamental cell functions,
including cell growth control, DNA repair, and the initiation of
apoptosis {programmed cell death). 953 is a highly conserved
gene which has been identified in many species. It is also the
heman gene most frequently identitied as being altered by
mutation in.a variety of human cancers, with mutations having
been identified-at the4majority of PSB’s 393 codons (3 DNA
nucleotide coding units which specify individual amino acids of
the P53 protein). Over 58% of human tumors aealyzed to date from
various sites, including the lung, have been found to have PS3
mutations. However, the fact that many human and experimental
animal tumors do not epyear to have detectable P53 mutations
indicates that such mutations are not a mandatory step in the
incomeletely-understood process of carcinogenesis.

ABSTRACT The retroviral oncogene gin codes for a pro-
tein that belongs to the family of the winged helix transcrip-
tion factors. The viral Qin protein. v-Qin. differs front its
‘ellular counterpart. c«Qin. by functioning as a stronger
.ranscriptional repressor and a more efficient inducer of
tumors. This observation suggests that repression may be
important in tuntorigenesis. To test this possibility. chimeric
proteins were constructed in which the Oil DNA~binding
domain was fused to either a strong repreasor domain (derived
from the Dmnplu‘ln Engrailed protein) or a strong activator
domain (from the herpes simplex virus W16 protein). The
chimeric transcriptional repressor. Qin—Engrailed. trans-
formed chicken embryo fibroblasts in culture and induced
.arcomas in young chickens. The chimeric activator. Qin-
VPlo. failed to transform cells in vitro or in vivo and caused
cellular resistance to oncogenic transformation by Qin. These
data support the conclusion that the Qin protein induces
oncogenic transformation by repressing the transcription of
genes which function as negative growth regulators or tumor
suppressors.

______.__————-———-

The oncogene 40: was Isolated as a cell-derived insert in the
;enorne of avian retrowrus ASVBl. a virus that induces
neoplastic transformation in cell culture and sarcomas in
young chickens. The Viral qin gene (v-qm) u the oncogenic
determinant of ASV31. The v-qm gene differs from its cellular
counterpart c-qur by an N-terminal leader sequence. several aa
substitutions and a C-terminal deletion (1. 2). The Girl proteins
{V-Oin and c-Oin) belong to the family of winged helix
transcription factors (2. 3). More the hay members of tits
family have been described in recent year: my are found in
east. Drosophila. Caenornobdim eipts. Xenopus. rodents.
and humans (4. 5). The functions of ringed helix proteins are
related to embryonal development and time differentiation;
these proteins are expressed in a highly tissue-specific manner
(6). A familiar example for winged helix-controlled differen-
tiation is the nude mouse whose phenotype results from a
defect in the win- gene (7).

The c-Qin protein is the avian homolog of the mammalian
brain factor 1 (BF-l); expression of this protein is restricted to
'he telenoephalon. the nasal half of the retina. and the optic
“HR (1. B). A null mutation of the mouse BF! gene leads to
death at birth accompanied by dramatic size reduction of the
cerebral hemispheres (9). Some genes coding forwinged helix
proteins have oncogenic potential (3. l0. ll). Viral out induces
neoplastic transformation. presumably due to aberrant tran~
scriptional regulation and ectopic expression. In transient
transfection. the Om proteins act as transcriptional repressors.
suggesting that this activuy may play a role in oncogenicity (2).

To examine this possibility. we constructed chimeric transcrip-
tion factors containing the Oin DNA-binding motif and hei-
erologous regulatory domains of either the Drosoplula En-
grailed or herpes simplex Virus VPlo proneins. The properties
of these chimeric proteins support the conclusion that tran-
scriptional repression is a requirement for neoplastic transfor-
mation induced by Oin.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Plasmid Construction. To create Qin-Engrailed (En) chi-
meras. the PCR-amplified fragments of mgrmlcd (ammo acids
2-298) (12) and v-qm (amino acids l-ZSI l (3) or chicken c-qm
(amino acids l-243) (i) value cloned consecutively into the
Hdell-Xbal or BamHl-Hmdlil sites of the same pBK/RSV
vector (Stratagene). Oligonucleotide primers designed for
PCR included Banii-ii. Hindlll. and anI restriction sites
allowing in-frame cloning. All DNA fragments derived from
PCR ampliﬁcation were sequenced using primers internal to
the qm or engmtled coding sequences or T3 and T7 primers,
Oin-VPl6 chimeras were constructed by exchanging an Expl—
EcoRl fragment of either c-qm or v-qm With a BumHl-EcoRl
fragment of plasmid 597.1 coding for thc transacuvation
domain of the VPlb protein (13). The coheswe ends generated
by Bani-ll or Espl digestion were filled in with Klenow
polymerase. The resultant Oin-VP16 and Oin-En plasmids
were cleaved with either BomHl-EcoRl or BamHl-Clal for
cloning into the retrovual expression vector RCAS (14) to
yield RCAS-Oin-En and RCAS-Oin-VPlo. Transfection of
chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF) with the RCAS vectors
leads to the production of infectious RCAS retrovrruses that
replicate and express the cloned insert. The recrprocal recom-
binants between worn and c-qui. VC and CV. have been
described (2).

Electrophoretic Mobillty Shift Assays. Circular pBK/ RSV
plasmids with inserts coding for c-Qin. v-Oin. c-Oin-En.
V-Qin-En. c-Oin-VPlé. or v-Oin-VPlb were used as tem-
plates form ruro translation in a transcription and translation
coupled system according to the manufacturer‘s protocol
(Promcga). Wheat germ lysates containing translated proreins
were used in electrophorctic mobility shift assays as described
(2). The relative amounts of translated proteins were estimated
by labeling the proteins with [“Slmethiomnc (40 uCi in 50 ul
reaction volume: l Ci I 37 GBq) followed by SDS/PAGE and
autoradiography.

Transfection and Focus Assays. Assays for transcriptional
regulation in CEF cultures were carried tiul using transient
transfcciion with the calCium phosphate precipitation mcthod
(l5). CEF were plated 20 h before transfection at a density of

SUBJECT: Mark R. Green, M.D. #4148 "Lung Cancer: Tissue

Acquisition and Molecular Analysis"
SECONDARY REVIEWER:

Dr. Green hypothesizes that heritable genetic characteristics are
important in conferring variable susceptibility to the initiation
and promotion of lung cancer. Should a molecular genetic
foundation for this hypothesis be found, it could then provide
elucidation with respect to the evolution of lung cancer. This
would then have implications for early detection, therapy, and
possibly even prevention through identifying high-risk individuals.
Such a molecular genetic loci could also enable the determination
of genetic targets for environmental carcinogens within the lung.
This could involve chemoprevention.

Dr. Green will attempt to identify genetic components which may
play an etiologic role in the transition of normal lung tissue to
lung cancer. This will involve differential mRNA Display PCR (mRNA
"fingerprinting") (DDP) and Representational Difference analysis
(RDA) which are recently developed molecular techniques which have
promise in terms of permitting rapid identification of molecular
variances at the genomic and transitional level between neoplastic
and normal tissue counterparts. These methodologies will be
employed in Dr. Green's grant.

It is anticipated that between 25 to 40 patients per year will be
recruited, at which time blood draws and tissue procurement will be
attained. These patients will be interviewed and seen in the
Multi-Disciplinary Second Opinion Lung Cancer Clinic. This
interview will include their smoking history.

The aims will include the mentioned molecular genetic methodologies
which, if successful, may be able to address the P.I.'s hypothesis.
With some degree of optimism, this could then translate into the
clinic.

This is a well thought-out study which is based on methodologies at
the cutting edge of molecular biology. The patient and specimen
collection should be readily facilitated in that Dr. Green is the
Director of the Program for Lung Cancer Research and Head of the
Lung Cancer Clinical Research Program at the UCSD Cancer Center.
This is a highly pertinent study.

Joseph D. Fenstermacher, Ph.D., State University of New York

Dr. Fenstermacher a professor of physiology and biophysics in
Stonybrook, New York, is interested in experiments on the rat t0‘
determine and relate local cerebral blood flow and correlate it with
local glucose utilization. He divided his goals in a whole series of
subdivisions, and hypotheses. These hypotheses are related to the
effect of nicotine on both cerebral blood flow and cerebral glucose
utilization. For that purpose two experimental series of rats will be
used, control and those with nicotine exposure. All methods are highly
indirect. For example, he will use quantitative autoradiography, in
which the optical density is related to the radioactivity from standard
data, he will use light microscopy in order to study morphometry. Blood
flow will be measured with 14C iodoantipyrine. He seems to believe
quite firmly in the idea that there is recruitment of blood vessels in
the brain, a fact which has never been verified by direct observations.
He also thinks that with this methodology he is able to determine volume
of perfused microvessels. Despite a multiplicity of specific aims and
hypotheses, it really boils down to a correlation between local blood
flow and local glucose utilization.

Since all methods are indirect, they are beset with a
difficulty of drawing conclusion which are very involved and difficult
to substantiate. For example, quantitative autoradiography, iodoanti-
pyrine measurement of surface area and permeability products all these

are highly speculative.

Anion-Exchange Chromatography to Determine the Concentration of
Chloride in Sweat for Diagnosis of Cystic Fibrosis
Marvin E. Miller, Janice M. Cosgrifl, and Robert H. Schwartz

For the diagnosis of cystic librosis, we use the “Macroduct
Sweat Collection System" (Wescor) to sample sweat, and
anion-exchange chromatography to determine its chloride
content. The chromatographic system consists of a What-
man Partisil SAX 10pm column, an isocratic phosphate-
buflered mobile phase, and ultraviolet detection at 200 nm,
The sweet chloride concentrations of 10 individuals with
cystic fibrosis ranged from 101 to 131 mmol/L (mean111. SD
9 mmol/L), For 11 controls the values ranged from 13 to 54
mmol/L (mean 28, SD 11 mmol/L), We conclude that the
procedure is reliable for the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis.

Cystic ﬁbrosis (CF) is usually suspected on clinical
grounds, and the diagnosis is conﬁrmed by ﬁnding an above-
normal electrolyte concentration in sweat, as reﬂected by
chloride, sodium, or osmolality. Various analytical tech-
niques for these sweat determinations include chloridome-
tric titration (1), chloride-selective electrodes (2), electrical
conductivity (3), and most recently, osmometry (4, 5). We
used a commercial sweat-collection system to obtain our
sweat samples, and we have developed a liquid—chromato-
graphic procedure for determining the concentration of
chloride in sweat.

Materials and Methods

Apparatus. For chromatographic analyses we used a
Varian 50208 liquid-chromatographic system equipped
with a UV-100 detector that was interfaced with a Varian
4270 integrator (all from Varian Associates, Instrument
Division, Palo Alto, CA 94303), and a 250 X 4.6 mm (id)
Partisil-IO SAX column (Whatman Inc., Cliﬁon, NJ 07014),
operated at 22 “C, The mobile phase was KH2P04 (10
mmollL, pH 4.6). The ﬂow rate was 2.0 mL/min from 0 to 5
min, then 07 mL/min until the chloride peak was complete-
ly eluted, at about 10 min. The pressure was 10 133 kPa
(100 atm) at 2.0 mlJmin, then 4053 kPa (40 atm) at 0.7
mL/min. The wavelength for detection was 200 nm. We

injected 5 uL of sweat for each sample. The concentration of
chloride in sweat was determined by the area under the
chloride peak, as compared with those of known chloride
standards, for which absorbence at 200 nm was linearly
related to physiological concentrations of chloride in sweat
(0—150 mmol/L).

For comparison, we determined sweat osmolality with a
vapor pressure osmometer (Wescor, Logan, UT 84321), a
method shown to be reliable in the diagnosis of CF (4, 5 ).

Reagents. We used reagent-grade monobasic potassium
phosphate and doubly distilled de-ionized water to prepare
the mobile phase, which was then ﬁltered and de-gassed.
Standard chloride solutions were prepared with doubly
distilled de-ionized water and reagent-grade sodium chlo-
ride,

Procedures. We sampled sweat from 10 individuals with
CF and from 11 normal controls, using the “Macroduct
Sweat Collection System" (Wescor‘) (4). This system uses
pilocarpine iontophoresis followed by sweat collection in a
"Macroduct”—a disposable, half-dollar size, plastic device
that ﬁts snugly over the iontophoresed skin and is secured
by Velcro straps. The sweat ﬂows into a small hole at the
center of the “Macroduct” and into a microbore spiral plastic
tube. The intact sweat is then directly injected into the
chromatographic system.

Results and Discussion

The sweat chloride concentrations and sweat osmolalities
of the CF individuals and controls are shown in Table 1. In
patients with CF the concentrations of chloride in sweat
were 101 mmol/L or more, whereas controls had values 54
mmol/L or less These results were consistent with the
known phenotypes of the controls and the CF patients. in
addition, there was complete agreement of the sweat chlo-
ride concentrations with the sweat osmolality determina-
tions.

This anion—exchange chromatographic method for diagno-
sis of CF is simple, rapid, and inexpensive. The procedure is
made possible by the ease and reliable procurement of sweat
with the Macroduct Sweat Collection System, a system that
potentially can be used in connection with a variety of
analytical techniques.

This sweat collection system overcomes many of the
problems of previous approaches (6). Its advantages include:
no condensate error, an easily visible sample, complete
recovery of sweat (i.e., there is almost no dead space),

Heredity, Personality Traits. Product Attitude, and
Product Consumption—An Exploratory Study

' INTRODUCTION

This article focuses on the relationships bctw een per-
sonality traits. product attitude. and product consump-
tion. It has been assumed in most previous studies in
this area [1. 2. 6. 7. l6. l7. l9. 25. 26. 27. 29] that
some forrn' of reciprocal relationship exists between
product attitude or consumption and speciﬁc personality
traits. There is evidence [4. 8. ll. l2. l4] which suggests
that personality in itself—is affected by heredity. in this
article we shall examine the extent to which heredity can
explain the variance in speciﬁc personality traits, prod-
uct attitude. and product consumption, individually as
well as their interrelationships”

The selection of products and personality traits for
this study was based on results front previous studies.
For personality traits. extraversion-introvcrsion (El) and
anxiety (A) were selected using scales devised by; Es;
scnck [101 and Bendigjgl respectively. Eysenclr and
Prcll {l3}. Eyscnclt—TW. and Shields [20] found these
traits to have a signiﬁcant genetic component. For prod-
uct attitude and consumption. cigarettes. coffee. and al~
cohol were selected for two reasons. First. consumers of
the products tend to develop habitual patterns of con-
sumption. making it diflicull for them to stop. Second.

showed a signiﬁcant heritability on the amount con-
sumed. Although the relationship. if any. between ha-

bitual consumption and heredity has not been estab-.

betw een the two. . .
Some evidence was introduced by Smart [2|]. who
found a curvilinear relationship between anxiety and the
frequency of drinking among college students, using
Taylor's Manifest Anxiety Scale. Eyscnck [l2]‘found
'estraversion to be related to cigarette smoking. and
Smith [22. 23]. in two separate studies using college stu-
dents and preadult subjects and a diﬂcrent scale from
the one developed by Eyscnclt. has found that smokers
scored signiﬁcantly higher on measures of extrav‘crsion.

Abstract—This paper and the two following papers (Parts l—lll) report an investigation of
performance variability for four multivariabie methods: discriminant function analysis. and
linear, logistic, and Cox regression. Each method was examined for its perfomianoe in using
the same independent variables to develop predictive models for survival of a large when. of
patients with lung cancer. The cogent biologic attributes of the patients had previously been
divided into the ordinal stages having a strong prognostic gradient. With stratiﬁed random
sampling, we prepared seven “generating sets of data in which the ﬁve biologic stages were
arranged in proportional, uniform. symmetrical unit-nodal decreasing exponentiai,’ increas'ng
exponential, U-shapod, or bin-nodal distributions. Each of the multivariable methods was
applied to each of the seven generating distributions, and the results were Desmd in a separate
“challenge" set. which had not been included in any of the generating sets. The res-arch was
intended not merely to compare the performance or the multivariable methods, but also to
see how their performance would be affected by different statistical distributions of the same
cogent biologic attributes. The results, which are presented in the second and third papers.
were compared for selection of independent variables and coelﬁcients. and for accuracy in

Sales expected to hit
$350 million in 1970;
tape volume also soars

Time was when only a relatively
few Americans owned tape re—
corders, Most of them were the “hi—
fi" hobbyists. who were willing to
put up with the need for threading
tape from one reel to another . . .
with the agony of watching tape
come spilling out of the machinery
in wild disarray because of some
malfunction.

The dedicated hi—ﬁ aﬁcionados
still. for the most part. stay with
their open—reel machines. But mil-
lions of the more fumble-ﬁngered
public have come into the tape re-
corder market, as a result of the ad-
vent of the cassette—the self—con—
tained unit in which tape moves
from one reel to the other without
need for the user ever to touch the
reel or the tape.

So popular. so ubiquitous has the
cassette recorder become that indus-
try leaders estimate L'. S. retail vol—
ume will reach $350 million in 1970.
This would represent an increase of
more than 150% over 1969.

AMERlCAN Dkuccrsr‘s most re-
cent big ticket survey indicated that
more than 16,000 drug stores car—
ried cassette recorders.

Nor is the business limited to the
recording devices. A cassette re-
corder is of no use without cassette
tape—and sales of blank tape are
expected to exceed $80 million this
year. .

\Nhile no one knows for sure——
because the market is still in its for-
mative stages—what percentage of
the business is done by drug stores,
guesses by those in the ﬁeld vary
frib‘hn 15l% to 17%.

Stimulation. of the peripheral circulation
is of decided beneﬁt in the treatment 'of a
number of clinical conditions, especially Ray—
naud’s disease, reﬂex sympathetic dystrophy,
and vasospasrn accompanying arteriosclerosis
obliterans as well as thromboangiitis obliter-
ans. Such an increase in the blood ﬂow to
the extremities can be accomplished through
medication with vosodilating drugs, however
always at the risk of certain undesirable side
reactions, as for instance, sleepiness, or dizzi-
ness. it was therefore decided to determine
whether or not the new quatemary amine 2,6
dimethyl diethyl piperidinium bromide (SC
1950),l synthesized by I. C. Winter and his
associates, increases the blood ﬂow to the
extremities and thus excrts a signiﬁcant in-
ﬂuence upon peripheral circulation. This
drug, described as a ganglionic blocking agent,
has proved in animal experiments to be
several times as potent as teti'aetliylainiiion-
ium bromidC(1) and results in man and dog
in lowering of blood pressure, reduction of
tonus, and concomitant increase in the skin
temperature of the t06(2).

Methods and materials. The effectiveness
of SC 1950 was studied in 5 normal indi-

A System for Monocytic Differentiation of Leukemic Cells HL 60 by a Short
Exposure to 1 ,25-Dihydroxycholeoalciferol (42098)

GEORGE P. STUDZINSKI, AMARJIT K. BHANDAL, AND ZAMIR S. BRELVI

Abstract. The human promyelocy‘tic cell line HL 60 can be induced to differentiate toward
more mature myeloid or monocytic forms by a variety of agents. This process is thought to
require several days of exposure to the inducer, thus making it difﬁcult to identify the early
cellular changes which are fundamental to the differentiation program, and to relate the
induction to phases of the cell cycle. In order to study the kinetics of leukemic cell diﬂ'erentiation
we have developed a system for the induction of rapid monocytic maturation in a subpopulation
of HL 60 cells. The cells are exposed to 10’7 M l,25—dihydroxycholeealciferol for 4 hr in
serum—free medium. Subsequent incubation in a complete medium results in cellular differen-
tiation recognizable by several criteria '(phagocytosis, nonspeciﬁc esterase reaction, adherence
to substratum, cell morphology) beginning at [0 hr from the exposure to the inducer.
Approximately 20 hr later 30—40% of the cells in culture show the diﬂ'erentiated phenotype
and are capable of phagocytosis. The proportion of differentiated cells in culture decreases
thereafter. This system has been utilized to study the expression of c-myc oncogene in relation
to the kinetics of maturation, and it was found that the inhibition of the expression of this
gene precedes the onset of phenotypic differentiation by approximately 8 hr, is transient, and
is accompanied by a brief retardation of cell proliferation, which resumes the normal rate
within 24 hr of the exposure to the inducer. © 1985 Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine.

___——_—___—___._———-——

HL 60 cells, isolated from a patient with
a promyelocytic leukemia (l), have provided
a useful model for maturation of leukemic
cells. In culture, these cells show a low level
of spontaneous differentiation, and essentially
complete conversion to terminally differen-
tiated forms can be induced by a variety of
chemical compounds. For instance, dimethyl
sulfoxide (2) and retinoic acid (3) produce
conversion in 6—10 days to predominantly
granulocytic cellular forms, while phorbol
esters (4), lymphocyte-conditioned medium
(5), and vitamin D derivatives (6—9) induce
the monocytic/macrophage pathway of dif-
ferentiation after 3—7 days in culture.

The long periods of time required for the
phenotypic manifestations of the inducer ac-
tion suggest that a complex series of steps is
necessary for the expression of the dilferen-
tiation program, and indicate to some that
the process is stochastic in nature (10, 11).
However, a relationship to a speciﬁc cell
cycle event cannot be ruled out in experi—
mental systems which utilize periods of in-
duction greater than 24 hr, since this repre-
sents almost an entire generation cycle for

optimally growing BL 60 cultures. In this
situation cells are successively recruited into
the differentiation program as they repeatedly
traverse the cell cycle in the presence of the
inducer, making it impossible to relate
changes in cell cycle-linked events to the
maturation process.

Several studies addressed the question of
the minimal length of exposure of HL 60
cells to the inducer which can result in
phenotypic expression of differentiation sev-
eral days later. Treatment with dimethyl sulf-
oxide for 12 hr resulted in granulocytic dif—
ferentiation of 20% of cells when examined
6 days later (10). Monocytic differentiation
of HL 60 cells with 1,25-dihydroxycholecal-
ciferol (1,25(OH)2D3), one of the most potent
inducers of differentiation, appeared to re-
quire an even longer period of induction of
differentiation, being variously estimated as
30 hr (11) or 18 hr (9), for a minimal
expression of morphological or functional
indicators of monocytic differentiation, as
determined after a total of 4 (11) or 7 (9)
days. These results suggested that, relative to
events which occur at the molecular level,

COMMENTS ON CANCER INCIDENCE

 

Epidemiological studies of death rates have claimed that a strong
association exists between cigarette smoking and increased risk of death in cancer
of (a) lung and bronchus, (b) buccal cavity and pharynx, and (c) prostate.

If one is interested in analyzing the factors that may be involved
in the causation of cancer, the incidence of the various types of that disease is
more pertinent to analysis than are death rates.

No attempt to cover all epidemiological data on cancer morbidity
has been made but the data from reports by two State Departments of Health(l’2)
are sufficiently challenging to justify their presentation and to urge further
collection, study and analysis of similar data from other sources.

As examples of the claimed increased risk of cigarette smokers

(3)

over non-smokers, Hammond and Horn 1958 give the figures of 31 times for lung
cancer, 7 times for buccal cavity_cancer, and 1.90 for genito.urinary cancer in"
white males. Skin cancer is not included as such in their data. There is,
however, a "catchall" classification of cancer of "other specific sites," in which
skin cancer would be presumably included. In this group, the death rate among
cigarette smokers is recorded as being only 0.89 that of non-smokers.

It is fair to state, therefore, that there is no epidemiological
evidence of association of cigarette smoking with death from skin cancer.

It has repeatedly been claimed that the generally-admitted increase
in cigarette smoking during the past several decades is a significant, if not the
main, causative factor in the increased death rate from lung, buccal cavity and

prostatic cancer.

Let us see whether incidence rates of these diseases bear out this

sweeping and basic hypothesis. Data are given in Table l.

anethole (Le Bourhis, 1973). A major portion of a 1 mg dose administered to
two human subjects was excreted in the urine as 4rmethoxyhippuric acid
(Sangster et al., 1987).

In another study, human volunteers given an oral dose range of 1 - 250 mg
(~0.01 - 5 mg/kg) trans-anethole exhibited metabolic patterns similar to
those seen in high-dose rodent studies. 4-Methoxyhippuric acid was the major
metabolite and the majority of the dose was eliminated. within 8 hours
(Caldwell and Sutton, 1988). In mice and rats, [methoxy-“CJ anethole is
extensively metabolized by o-demethylation and oxidative transformation of
the three-carbon side chain, yielding a variety of products (Sangster et al.,
1984a).

Reed and Caldwell (1992) report that trans-Anethole exhibited a modest enzyme
inducing effect in female Charles River SD-CD rats following administration
of either 300 mg/kg/day trans-anethole for 7 days or 0%, 0.25%, and 1.0% in
diet for 21 days. Appropriate vehicle and positive controls were included
for both assays. Anethole did not appear to be a potent, broad-spectrum
inducer of hepatic enzyme activity in a screening study in Sprague-Dawley
rats and CD-1 mice (unpubl).

Mortality - Cumulative mortality for the L050 study is presented in
Table 2. Total mortality data are presented graphically in Appendix 1.

No deaths were observed at the 464, 68» or 1000 mg/kg dose levels. At
the 1470 mg/kg dose level, two males died by Day 3 and two females died within
3 hours of dosing. All animals dosed at the 2150 mg/kg dose level were dead
by Day 2.

Clinical Signs - Clinical signs are summarized in Table 3.

Huith the exception of lethargy observed on Day 1 in two females, no
clinical signs were observed in animals at the 464 mg/kg dose level.

' Lethargy was observed on Day 1 in all animals dosed at the 681 mg/kg dose
level. Except for one male, which appeared thin on Day tijand one female with
a scab on the nose (Day 6) and arstain on the nose (Days 7 and 8),. all animals
were normal by Day 2 and for the remainder of the study. ’

      

 

At the 1000 mg/kg dose level lethargy was observed in all animals on
Day 1; prostration was also observed in two wales. All animals were normal by

Materials and methods

Forty-two adult male and female albino
rabbits, that initially weighed batwccn 1.6
and 2.0 kg, survived or satisﬁed the re—
quirements of the experiment. Group 1
consisted of ten animals that. were sub.
jected to CS of one cigarette daily for six
days per week. Estimated on a \vgci crht
basis one cigarette per d:- .y in a rabbit is
equivalent to smoking 30 cigarettes per
day in man. They were maintained on a
standard laboratory ration and water ad
lib. Group 2 consisted of a similar number

that received the standard ration to which
2’5 cholesterol was added. These animals
were placed withint the smoking chamber
for an equivalent time to those in group 1
except they were not exposed to CS. There
were 12 animals in group 3 that won: sub-
jected to CS as those in group 1. These-
were maintained on the ration containing
cholesterol. Ten rabbits 0! group 4 received
the regular ration without cholesterol.
These were placed within the smoking
chamber but as with those in group 2 were
not exposed to CS.

All animals were killed after 11 to 13
months of CS and/or cho! sterol adminis-
tration or the Sham CS procedure.

PROJECT : ANALYSIS OF N-NITROSONORNICOTINE (NNN)
_____L____________________________~_________~___

INTRODUCTION

The analysis of volatile nitrosamines in tobacco smoke
(mainstream and sidestream) has been worked out in this

lab using the TEA detector. It is now desirable to have
available a routine procedure for the non-volatile, tobacco—
specific nitrosamines in both processed tobacco and tobacco
smoke. It is also planned to apply this method to indoor
studies and to monitor NINO extracts.

PROCEDURES

A review of the current literature was made and there are
several chromato'raphic methods available : TLCl), GLC2”41
GC-MSS), HPLC6‘8? and HPLC-TEAg). Although the analysis

of NNN is the major goal, it is conceivable to include

 

other tobacco—specific nitrosamines such as NNK and N-nitroso—

anatabin (NAtB). The possible presence of the latter was
first mentioned by Klus and Kuhnl) and later confirmed by
mass spectrometry, for both tobacco and tobacco smokeg).

It is planned to apply‘GLC, HPLC and HPLC-TEA methods and
to compare the results obtained in addition to the feasi-

bility to have a technician use a practical method on a
routine basis.

Notes:

1. Slightly higher pick—up rates of sizing were obtained with KHmalonate
and K+ levels are somewhat higher for these papers (2.1—2.5% vs.
2.5—3.3%). The paper porosities, however, were slightly tighter
for KHsuccinate papers. ;

2. KHsuccinate series appears more effective for SS reductiony
especially since K+ levels are lower, but this is partially
accounted for by longer SBTs-

3. Ternary paper does not offer an advantage fer these acidic‘sizingSr

4. Surprisingly good performance is obtained with 45 g/ﬁ? binary paper.
Its lower total filler level may be a factor affecting its response
to acidic salt sizing.

5. Ash appearance of binary papers is generally better than that of
ternary paper.

Human Coronavirus Receptors

Background and Significance

Coronaviruses are one of 14 RNA virus families that infect humans and a broad range
of domestic animal species. Some of the viruses appear to be zoonotic. They are a
medically important group of viruses exhibiting tropisms for the lung, intestine, liver,
brain, kidney, eye, heart, and peritoneum resulting primarily in respiratory,
gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and neurological diseases. In humans, they are known
to cause acute respiratory infections and gastroenteritis. However, they have been
implicated in association with acute lethal necrotizing enterocolites in children (Science
2292978, 1985), chronic enterocolites or Sprue (Dig. Dis.Sci. 2721039, 1982),
pericarditis (J. Med. Virol. 6:259, 1980) and multiple sclerosis (Science 2092933,
1980; Ann. Neurol. 31:525, 1992; Talbot et a1, Virol, in press). Two recent studies
show that a signiﬁcant sample of multiple sclerosis brain tissue was positive when
either speciﬁc probes or PCR were used to detect coronavirus nucleic acid (Ann.
Neurol. 312525, 1992; Talbot et a1, Virol., in press). This is particularly signiﬁcant
since coronaviruses infect humans and could possibly serve as a cofactor in such a
neurological disease. Recently a primate model was used to show that the primate CNS
is susceptible to infection with coronaviruses (Virol 1882274, 1992). It has been
clearly shown that coronaviruses can target to the brain of experimentally infected mice
(Perlman, et al., 1989, 1990). It seems reasonable to postulate that such may also
occur in humans during the course of a "normal respiratory infection" with these
viruses. It is well documented that coronaviruses can readily establish persistence in
both tissue culture and in the animal. This may apply to humans as well. Our
proposed studies are signiﬁcant in that they will increase our understanding of the
initial step in infection of the human respiratory tract by coronaviruses and allow us to
begin studies toward understanding how these viruses also infect the CNS.

Three receptors have been identiﬁed thus far for coronaviruses. The receptor for the
mouse hepatitis coronavirus—A59 (MHV-A59) is a member of the carcinoembryonic
antigen family. Aminopeptidase N, also known as CD13, was recently identiﬁed as the
receptor for the human coronavirus—229E and transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus
(TGEV) (Nature 357:417; 420, 1992). All of these coronaviruses have two major
envelope proteins, the spike (S) and matrix (M). In all cases S interacts with the
receptor. Some coronaviruses have, in addition to the S and M, a third major envelope
protein, the hemagglutinin—esterase (HE). BCV, a bovine coronavirus, expresses HE
and this protein can use N—acetyl-9—O—acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5,9Ac2) as a receptor
determinant to initiate an infection (J. Gen. Virol. 73:901, 1992). The data from this
study suggests that a second receptor may be involved. The rece tor s for the hunm
coronavirus OC43 has not been identiﬁed. HCV—OC43 does bind Neu5,9Ac2 on
erythrocytes (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA 85:4526); however, we do not know if this
is a receptor determinant on cells that are normally infected by this virus. Data from

HUMAN DILUTION MEASUREMENTS WITH VARYING LENGTHS OF CIGARETTES
EXTENDING FR M PUFF PROFILE ANALYZER HOLDER

Filter dilution determinations using the Puff Parameter
Analyzer QPPA) were made on Barclay-type cigarettesl for each
of 45 human smokers. For each subject, the filter dilution was
determined using three methods: (a) 10 mm of filter available
for the smoker, (b) 15 mm of filter available for the smoker,
and 0c) cigarette smoked with a plastic tip to prevent any
occlusion or crushing of the grooves. The objective was to
determine whether there was a consistent difference in the
reduction of filter dilution observed between having 10 or 15
millimeters of filter available to the smoker. This was
prompted by the fact that the_glass holder for the PPA leaves

10 mm of the cigarette filter exposed to the smoker which could

force the smoker to alter his puffing pattern.

The results, presented in Table 1, show that the test with
10 mm of filter available had an average dilution reduced to
32% with a standard deviation of 12%, while the test with 15 mm
of filter available had an average dilution reduced to 37% with
a standard deviation of 13%. While the difference between the
two methods is statistically significant, the magnitudesof the

reduction are of the same order using either method.

1Cigarettes with grooved filters and non—porous plugwrap were
made with the perforations located 17 millimeters from the
mouth end specifically for this test.

OBJECTIVES

To isolate, count and identify microorganisms that can be
found onxdifferent tobaccos and to screen them for their
ability to denitrate tobacco extract.

STATUS

Denitration : The isolated yeast strains Nosa 1011, 1014
and 1018 were re—tested for growth and denitration in
tobacco extract and in yeast extract /‘peptone / dextrose
broth. .The growth rates in tobacco extract were between
0.45 and 0u6 hr and in yeast extract between 0.65 and
0m8 hr . -

Strain lOLl was used for a growth and denitration trial in

the fermentor. The trial was not successful. A reason
may be that on the contrary to the shaken flask trials, the
pH was controlledr Agitation and aeration‘were also very
different. The‘trial will be repeated;

Edentificationlz Identification of the isolatediyeasts was
terminated. Finally, 11 strains out of the 25‘were found
to be identical.

 

Bacteria : A minimal (salt) medium, supplied with nitrate
or nitrite as a‘nitrogen source and ethanol as a carbon
source, was used to isolate denitrating andmdenitrifying
bacteria both aerobically and‘anaerobically. Different
strains were isolated and are currently being tested to
determine their characteristics (2). '

Plans : - Repeat the denitration trial in the fermentor
using strains 1011, 1014 and 10M8.
— Test isolated bacteria for denitration /
denitrification.
— Isolate bacteria at higher temperatures.
— Continue efforts for the identification of
bacteria.

Molecular mechanism of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and TNF receptors involvement in autoimmunity.

Project Description

We propose to study the regulatory role of TNF and its two receptors, TNFR—l and TNFR-Z, and the
mechanism of the involvement of this cytokine in the pathogenesis and genetic predisposition to
autoimmune disease.

Systemic lupus erythematosis (SLE), a prototypical human autoimmune disease, is a disorder of
generalized autoimmunity characterized by multi-system organ involvement and autoantibodies against
nuclear, cytoplasmic and cell surface antigens. The mechanism(s) responsible for the breakdown of
tolerance for these self antigens are unknown. In search for mechanisms responsible [or immune
dysregulation in SLE, cytokines have received increasing attention. One particular cytokine, TNF—(x has an
important protective role under the appropriate conditions in a mouse model of SLE, the (NZBxNZW)Fl
111106.

The TNF genes, which include the TNFa, LTa, and the recently cloned LTB genes, are unique among
all known cytokines and growth factors in that they are the only cytokine genes located within the central
portion of the Major Histocompatability Complex (MHC). Because of TNF‘s location, and because many
of its potential biological activities are related to immunoregulation and inﬂammation, the possibility that an
"abnormal" TNF gene could be involved in autoimmune diseases was tested experimentally. I have shown
that activated peritoneal macrophages from NZW mice produce 5- to 10-fold lower levels of TNFa than
non-autoimmune strains. Furthermore, this low TNF production was associated with a unique
polymorphism in a simple tandem repeat sequence identiﬁed within the promoter region of TNth. Most
importantly, treatment of NZBxNZW mice with recombinant TNFoc caused a very signiﬁcant reduction in
the incidence of nephritis and other autoimmune disease parameters in the treated mice.

Further studies have revealed that: (l) TNF production is reduced also in a subset of patients with
lupus, similarly to the (NZBXNZW)F1 mice that have an inherited lupus—like autoimmune disease. (2)
Lupus patients with low TNF inducibility have a 3—5 fold increase in nephritis incidence; (3) In classical
backcross experiments we showed that low TNF production in the NZW mouse is linked to the MHC;

In search of the mechanism of low TNF production in the lupus mouse, we have cloned and
sequenced the 5' regulatory regions from a total of 12 high- and low-TNF producer autoimmune and
normal mouse strains as well as the 3'UTR of the TNF gene, from the stop codon at position 6215-6217
downstream (approximately 1.0 kb), in several strains. Several single bp mutations in the S’region and
nine sites were found to be associated with mutational events in the 3’UTR. The most interesting
mutations were in the 3’UTR: a 5 base GACAC insertion at position 6381 and a 3 bp insertion of CAT,
which disrupts the first AU-motif of TNFoc in the NZW mouse. To probe the functional relevance of the
5' regulatory regions and the 3‘UTR mutations in the TNF gene, we have made constructs in which 5'
TNF promoter fragments from the low—TNF producer NZW mouse or from the high—TNF producer SWR
mouse were linked to the luciferasc reporter gene followed by 3'UTR sequences from the NZW mouse,
or 3‘UTR sequences from the non mutated SWR strain. The different constructs were transiently
expressed in the RAW 264 cell line, activated with LPS and IFN'y, and luciferase activity measured.
Results published recently (J. Immunol. article enclosed) suggest that mutations in the 3' untranslated
region of the TNF gene may be primarily responsible for the genetic defect in NZW mice. It is noteworthy
that, while luciferasc activities are signiﬁcantly reduced in the constructs with the 3‘UTR originating from
the NZW mouse, the level of luciferase mRNA is not affected suggesting that this is a post-transcriptional
effect.

As a ﬁrst step in investigating the regulatory mechanisms of TNF and their distinct signal transduction via
each receptor, we considered isolation and characterization of the mouse receptors to be important. The
cloning and sequencing of the TNF—R1 was recently completed and published.

We also cloned the mouse TNF—R2 and recently completed the sequence of the gene. We are now in a
strong position to be able to directly analyze and fully characterize the promoter of TNFR—Z in comparison
with the promoter of TNFR-l. In parallel with cloning of the promoters of the receptors for regulatory
studies, we have done regulatory experiments comparing the expression of the two TNF receptors using

INTRODUCTION

The paraffinic hydrocarbons present in tobacco leaf tis—
sue have received considerable attention. Tobacco leaf con—
tains many paraffins, with n—hentriacontane (C31H64) as the , .
major component (I). The C27, 029, C30, C32, and C33 paraffins
are also present, but in lesser concentrations. The total,
paraffin content is variable among the various types and grades
of tobacco, but is about 0.3% of the dry weight of the tobac-
co. Mold, et al (2) found that over 70% of the paraffin frac—
tion was made up of C31, C32, and C33 hydrocarbons.

Lam (3) reported in 1955 that the paraffin fraction of
tobacco extract pyrolyzed over pumice at 800°C, yielded meas-
urable quantities of polycyclic hydrocarbons, This finding
led to numerous studies by other investigators (4—9) to deter—
mine both the amount of paraffins present and the amount of
polycyclic hydrocarbons which might be generated from the par—
affin in the burning cigarette. Wynder and Hoffman (8) have
discussed these findings in some detail in their consideration

of the precursors of polyaromatic hydrocarbons in cigarette

ABSTRACT Human apolipoprotein E (apoE) is a ligand
for the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor and mediates the
cata bolism of several classes oflipoprotcin particles. Binding of
apoE to the LDL receptor requires association of apoE with
lipid in a vesicle or a lipoprotein particle. Because of this
requirement. puriﬁed apoE or apoE derived directly from
bacterial expression system does not bind to the LDL receptor.
To overcome this problem and to facilitate analysis of am!)
structure. recombinant baculoviruses containing the human
apoE cDNA fused to the polyhedrin promoter of Autographa
califarnica nuclear polyhedrosis virus were constructed. The
recombinant viruses were used to infect larvae of the tobacco
hornworm Manduca sum in viva. High levels of lipoprotein
particles containing human apoE were present in the he-
molymph of infected larvae. In contrast to spot?) produced by
recombinant baculovirus-infected insect cells in virro, these
particles were excellent ligands for the LDL receptor.

 

Human apolipoprotein E (apoE) is one of two known ligands
for the low density lipoprotein (LDL)receptor(1). It provides
the speciﬁcity required for the receptor-mediated clearance
of certain classes of lipoproteins. Genetic variation at the
apoE locus that results in defective receptor binding is
associated with hyperlipoproteinemia and accelerated coro
nary heart disease (1).

Although apoE is water-soluble when stripped from its
lipid milieu. binding of apoE to the LDL receptor requires
association of apoE with lipid in a vesicle or a lipoprotcin
particle (2). Thus. previous studies relating the structure of
apoE to its function have relied upon denaturation followed
by in vitro reconstitution of apoE with lipid (3). An alternative
approach to the production ofbiologically active apoE would
be to express this protein in a system that facilitates lipid
association in viva.

in vertebrates, neutral lipids are transported in association
with lipoprotein particles. This process is conserved in in-
sects. such as the tobacco hornworm Manduca sum (4. 5).
insect lipoproteins. like their mammalian counterpans. have
a core of nonpolar neutral lipids surrounded by a monolayer
of amphiphilic lipids (6). The insect apolipoprotein. apoli-
pophon'n III. has an amphipathic a-hclical secondary stmc-
ture (7). a motif suggested to play a role in the lipid binding
of mammalian apolipoproteins such as apoE (8).

ln insect larvae. the fat body is the site of synthesis of
hemolymph lipoproteins (9) and is also a target ofinfection by
baculoviruses (10). Therefore. we hypothesized that this in
viva system could be exploited to produce recombinant
Iipoprotcin panicles containing the products of heterologous

apolipoprotein genes, Such recombinant lipoproteins might
have similar biological properties to native mammalian lipo-
proteins. In the present study. recombinant baculoviruscs
possessing a human apoE cDNA in place of the polyhedrin
gene were constructed. After infection of M. sexra larvae.
high concentrations of human apoE were secreted into the
hemolymph in a lipid-associated and biologically active form.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Production of Recombinant Baculoviruses. A 1.2-kilobase-
pair (kbp) EcoRl~Hindlll fragment encoding the apoE-J
cDNA from plasmid pHE53 (11) was tailed with BamHI
linkers (Promega) and cloned into the BamHI site oprcYMl
(12). yielding pAcE3. An Aar lI-Hinl‘l 1.1-kbp fragment
corresponding to the apoE-3V cDNA from pHAE$13 (13)
was ligated into the Sma I site of pBluescript M13+ (Strat-
agene). An 8-bp BamHl linker (Promega) was then inserted
at the EcoRV site of this plasmid to produce p52~Bam. The
1.1-kbp BamHl fragfnent from pSZ-Bam was ligated into the
BamHl site of pAcYMl. yielding pAcESV. The resulting
plasmids were cotransfected with the wild-type baculovirus
genome [Autographa califomica nuclear polyhedrosis virus
(AcNPV)] into Spodoptera frugiperda Sf-Zl cells. Recombi-
nant viruses encoding apoE-3 and apoEJV (AcNPV-E3 and
AcNPV-ESV, respectively) were selected. plaque-puriﬁed.
and titered as described (14. 15).

Infection of Cultured Insect Cells and Insect Larvae. Viruses
were used to infect 4 x 10" Sf-21 cells per dish at a multiplicity
of infection of 10. SF-900 (GIBCO) medium (2 ml) was
harvested from infected cells 42 hr after infection. Fourth-
instar larvae [day 2: average mass. 0.5 g; reared as described
(16)] were injected with 1 x 10" plaque-fonning units (pfu) of
recombinant virus and administered a booster with 5 X 10"
pfu the following day. Hemolymph was collected 6 days after
infection and diluted 1:2 (vol/vol) with phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS; 150 mM NaCl/2.8 mM KCl/1.5 mM KH;
Poi/6.5 mM NazHPOb pH 7.4) containing 5 mM glutathionc.
0.002% phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuoride. and 0.3 mg of benz-
amidine per ml (PBSl). Media and hemolymph samples were
subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate/ 10% polyacrylamidc gel
electrophoresis (SDS/PAGE) (17). Immunoblotting (18) was
performed with anti-human apoE monoclonal antibodies 1E
and BE (19) and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-
rabbit lgG (Sigma).

Implantation and Uterine Function in the Rat.

Considerable evidence indicates that nicotine adversely affects
pregnancy in the rat. Among such disruptive effects are increased frequency of
fetal resorption, reduced litter size and weight, and delayed parturition. The
primary objective of the experiments embodied in this study is to gain a greater
understanding of the means by which nicotine exerts disruptive effects on the

 

normal course of pregnancy, and more particularly, how the chief alkaloid of tobacco

reduces litter size and delays parturition. To this end, a variety of parameters
will be measured to assess reproductive efficiency, time of implantation, fetal

growth and development, and normalcy of parturition in nicotine-treated vs.
control rats.

Several experimentally testable hypotheses are proposed. Specifically,
experiments will be conducted to determine if nicotine—induced reduction in litter
size and delay in parturition are related to alterations in uterine sensitivity
to implantation. The time of onset, magnitude and duration of sensitivity to
decidualization will be compared in treated and control rats. In addition, the

effects of nicotine on duration of gestation will be determined by an accurate
measurement of the time of parturition.

Recent experiments have demonstrated that both the development of the
preimplantation'blastocyst and the time of zona pellucida loss are delayed in
nicotine-treated rats. Experiments are in progress to assess: (l) the magnitude
of the delay, (2) the hormonal conditions under which it occurs, and (3) various
aspects of the intrauterine environment.

Abstract. Proﬁlirt is a conserved. widely distributed
aetin monomer binding protein found in eukaryotic
cells. Mammalian profilin reversibly sequesters actin
monomers in a high afﬁnity proﬁlactin complex. In
vitro. the complex is dissociated in response to treat-
ment with the polyphosphoinositides. phosphatidylinoL

bisphosphate. Here. we demonstrate the ultrastructural

content is a Iz-ls—ItD cytoplasmic actin monomer
P binding protein of eukaryotic cells (Carlsson et al..
I976: Magdolen et aL. 1988: Reichstein and Korn.
I979). Mammalian proﬁ lin occurs as a single isotype (Annie
et al.. I988: Kwiagtltowski and Bruns, I988) and interacts
with actin monomers to sequester them from recruitment
into actin ﬁlaments. In Vitro. the aﬂ‘inity of mammaltan spleen

complex have not been identiﬁed (Larsson and Lindberg.
I988). The transient appearance of the high aﬂinity complex
before and/or during platelet activation (Lind or al.. I987;
Markey et al.. I98I) suggests that some mechanism exists in-
side cells for its rapid formation and dissociation. Lassing
and Lindberg (I985) have demonstrated that the high affinity

PIP and PIP: consist of an acidic. phosphorylated inositol
side group connected to .1 glycerol backbone to which two
long hydrophobic acyl chains are attached. They are. there-
fore. likely to reside in cellular membrane compartments.
and indeed are widely thought to be localized to the inner
leaﬂet of the plasma membrane (Garrett and Redman. I975;
Mauco et aI. . I987). The presence of multiple distinct meta-
bolic pools of PI? and PIP: in erythrocytes and platelets
(Billah and lapetina. I982: King et aI.. I987). suggests.
moreover. that some PIP and PIP~ are sequestered in the
plasma (and perhaps other intracellular) membranem. pos-
sibly due to binding to cytoplasmic proteins (Anderson and
Marchesi. 1985: Sheet: et al.. I982).

In support of an intracellular interaction between proﬁlin
and membrane-bound PIP and PIP,. here we provide direct
morphologic evidence for a close association of a large por-
tion of cellular pmﬁlin with membranes in both intact human
platelets and lukocytes. In addition. we demonstrate a te-
versible. transient association between pmﬂlin and plasma
membrane after the activation of platelets. consistent with
previous observations of the formationldissociation of pro.
lilactin complexes during platelet activation.

Almost all higher animals require dietary
methionine for growth. although this need can
generally be met by its metabolic precursor homo
cysteine in the form of homocystine [I]. A similar
situation has been lound for primary cultures of
normal mammalian cells where either methionine
or a mixture including homocysteine. vitamin 3-12.
and folic acid is required for growth. However. in

ABSTRACT To facilitate understanding of the mecha-
nisms underlying pulmonary diseases, including lung cancer
and cystic ﬁbrosis. we have transformed and characterized
cultures of human tracheal epithelial cells. Cells were trans-
fected by calcium phosphate precipitation with a plasmid
containing a replication-defective simian virus 40 (SV40) ge-
nome. Colonies of cells with enhanced growth potential were
isolated and analyzed for transformation- and epithelial-
specific characteristics. Precrisis cells were observed to express
the SV40 large tumor antigen, produce cytokeratins, have
microvilli, and form tight junctions. After crisis, cells contin-
ued to express the SV40 large tumor antigen as well as
epithelial-speciﬁc cytokeratins and to display the apical mem-
brane microvilli. Apical membrane Cl channels were opened in
postcrisis cells exposed to 50 MM forskolin. These channels
showed electrical properties similar to those observed in
primary cultures. The postcrisis cells have been in culture for
>250 generations and are potentially “immortal." In addition
to providing a useful in vitro model for the study of ion
transport by human airway epithelial cells. the cells can be used
to examine stages of neoplastic progression.

 

Recent studies investigating mechanisms of carcinogenesis
have shown that cultured human epithelial cells from various
organs can be transformed by exposure to carcinogens,
viruses. and/or oncogenes (for reviews, see refs. 1 and 2).
Such cells possess altered growth properties that can be
correlated with their neoplastic potential. Foreskin and
mammary epithelial cells treated with chemicals or radiation
show enhanced growth capacity (3, 4). Human keratinocytes
(5) have been immortalized with Harvey murine sarcoma
virus (v-Ha-ras). Human keratinocytes, immortalized with
adenovirus type 12/simian virus 40 (AdlZ/SV40) hybrid
virus. become tumorigenic after subsequent exposure to the
Kirsten ras (KRAS) oncogene or a chemical carcinogen (6, 7).

In contrast to the relatively large number of studies
describing cells from other organs (recently reviewed in refs.
1 and 2). only three reports indicate transformation of
respiratory tract cells (8—10). Bronchial epithelial cells im-
mortalized with v-I-Ia-ras display anchorageindependent
growth and form tumors in nude mice. However, these cells
were poorly differentiated and did not contain tightjunctions
or keratins characteristic of differentiated epithelial cells.
The epithelial origin of the cells was veriﬁed by the presence
of keratin. A somewhat greater level of differentiation was
retained by diethylnitrosamine-transformed fetal tracheal
cells. which contained mucin. These cells also expressed
carcinoembryonic antigen and wool merokeratin and had
enhanced. although limited. growth capacity (9). A third

showed expression of the SV40 large tumor antigen (T
antigen) three to four subcultures posttransfection (10).

A goal of the present study was to develop a transformed
human tracheal epithelial (HTE) cell line for detailed studies
of the mechanisms regulating C1 ion transport. This aspect of
epithelial function is essential for rehydration of airway
mucus. Abnormalities in the Cl conductance pathway also
appear critical to disease processes such as those occurring
in cystic ﬁbrosis (11, 12).

Phenotypic characteristics have been well maintained in
SV40—transformed ﬁbroblasts (13—15). In SV40—transformed
epithelial cells (16—19), certain aspects of phenotype are
retained better than others (17, 18. 20, 21). A plasmid
containing a SV40 genome defective in the origin of replica-
tion (pSVori’) has been shown to enhance the transforma-
tion efﬁciency of human ﬁbroblasts (22). The defective origin
of replication precludes background virus replication and
eliminates the possibility of cell death or interference with
phenotypic expression in the host cell due to uncontrolled
viral DNA synthesis or production ofviral particles. We have
used the'pSVori’ plasmid to transform HTE cells. Trans
formed cells pass through a period of “crisis," after which
phenotype may change and loss of certain differentiated
functions may occur (21, 23). We have analyzed both pre- and
posterisis cells. Biochemical and morphological analyses
reveal that the cells retain some aspects of the original
phenotype even after crisis. These include the presence of
microvilli. responsiveness to neural agonists, keratin produc-
tion, and Cl ion transport.

METHODS

Cells and Culture Conditions. Cells were isolated from
trachea, as described, by enzymatic digestion (24) or as
outgrowths from tracheal tissue explants. Cells were plated
onto dishes coated with ﬁbronectin (Collaborative Research.
Waltham, MA), Vitrogen (GIBCO). and bovine serum albu-
min. Cultures were grown in LI-IC»8e medium (25) at 37°C
under 5% col/95% air.

Pure cultures of epithelial cells were generated by elim-
inating contaminating ﬁbroblasts through selective detach-
ment (26). Pure cultures of epithelial cells were grown to 70%
or 80% conﬂuence before subculturing into lOO-mm Pctri
dishes.

Transformation. The pSVori‘ plasmid was ampliﬁed in
bacteria and then isolated after banding on CsCl density
gradients (27). Since the transfection efﬁciency is increased
in linearized plasmids (22), pSVori _ was linearized with th)
I at a unique restriction enzyme site distal to the transforming
genes in the SV40 portion ofthe plasmid. The plasmid was cut
in a region distant to the SV40 genes to minimize endogenous
exonuclease damage to genes essential for transformation.

Furs-2 ﬂuorescence in single rat basophilic leukemia
cells was monitored to study the rise in intracellular
free ionized calcium ([Ca‘*];) produced by aggregation
of immunoglobulin E receptors. Repetitive transient
increases in [Ca'“],- were induced by antigen stimula-
tion and were measured using digital video imaging
microscopy at high time resolution. The [Ca“].— oscil-
lations were not dependent upon changes in the mem-
brane potential of the cells and were observed in cells
stimulated with antigen either with or without extra-
cellular Ca“. Transient oscillations in We“), were also
observed when calcium inﬂux was blocked with La".
These results suggested that during antigen stimula-
tion of cells under normal physiological conditions,
release of Ca“ from intracellular stores makes an im-
portant contribution to the initial increase in [Ca2+]i.
Oscillations in [0212*], are not induced by elevating
[Caz‘], with the calcium ionophore ionomycin. Mito-
chondrial calcium buffering is not required for [0112*],-
oscillations to occur. The results show that rat basa-
philic leukemia cells have signiﬁcant stores of calcium
and that release of calcium from these stores can par-

ticipate in both the initial rise and the oscillations in
[Ca"].—.

Rat basophilic leukemia (RBLl‘ cells are a tumor mast cell
line that responds to stimuli that aggregate surface receptors
for immunoglobulin E (lgE), generating a large rise in intra-
cellular free ionized calcium ( [Ca2+],) and ultimately resulting
in secretion of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity. It
has long been known that Ca2+ plays a critical role in the

initiation and control of secretory behavior in many different

cell types. Furthermore. studies in mast cells using Ca”
ionophores have established a causal relationship between the
increase in [CaH]. and secretion (1, 2). Changes in [Ca”]. in
RBL cells have largely been attributed to the inﬂux of Cat“
from the extracellular medium (3—6). However. the involve-
ment of releasable calcium stores in the control of cellular
processes has been documented in many cell types, and cal-
cium stores have recently been implicated in the generation
of elevated [03“]. in RBL cells2 (5, 7, 8). Indeed, stores are
sufﬁcient to supply enough calcium to support much of the
early phase of the rise in [0213’]. in these cells (5).

Digital video imaging of ﬂuorescent indicators has been
used to study changes in [Ca2+], in a number of different cell
types (9—18) including REL cells (19). Current studies by us
and by others have shown remarkable differences between the
measurements of [Cab], in populations of cells and those
obtained from the individual cells that comprise the popula-
tion. In our early work (19), the [C821, responses of individual
RBL cells stimulated by cross-linking surface IgE receptors
were found to be preceded by lag times of variable length;
once initiated, the rise in [Ca2+],- was much more rapid than
might be predicted from ﬂuorometric studies with cell suspen-
sions. It has been observed that [011“], in different types of
cells stimulated with a variety of agonists ﬂuctuates markedly
(20), sometimes in concert with repetitive spiking of the
membrane potential (21—24). Because of technical restrictions
frequently associated with digital video microscopy. high time
resolution measurements of [03“].- have often been carried
out using one cell at a timer Signiﬁcant improvement of the
temporal resolution of [03“], imaging measurements has
allowed us to record simultaneously the marked, frequently
oscillating increases of [Ca2+].- in many stimulated RBL cells.

In this ‘study, we have begun to characterize the [Ca2+].-
oscillations, to identify their source, and to determine what
cellular components are involved in their control. We have
found that oscillations in [Cahh can still occur when the
membrane potential is clamped and do not require calcium
inﬂux from the extracellular solution. The [021“],- oscillations

appear to occur as the result of modulation of [Oak], by
exchange with intracellular stores.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

incubation with a monoclonal lgE directed against the dinitrophenyl
hapten was carried out in Eagle‘s minimal essential medium (GIBCO)

lnterferons and 2-5A Expression in Alzheimer's Disease Fibroblasts . Joseph M. Wu, Phd

INVESTIGATOR. Dr. Wu is 44. He did his undergraduate work at McGill, his PhD in
biological sciences at Florida State University, graduating in 1975 following which he did
a postdoc in Biochemistry at Temple. He has been at New York Medical College since
1978 and a professor in the department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology since 1987.
He reports 72 published papers and lists 9 publications relevant to the proposed work.
Also included is a C.V. for Shac-jian An, a research associate from China who has been
with Dr. Wu for the past 2 years. He had worked on 2-5A synthetase while still at the
Institute of Microbiology in Beijing and has continued this work at NY Medical College.

BUDGET. This is a renewal application. Current funding is $80,000 per year and the same
amount is requested for the continuation. Dr. Wu will devote 15% effort to this project
and requests $15,441 towards his salary. Shao-jian An is listed for 100% effort and 50%
salary recovery is requested for a technician who will maintain the cultured cells and
perform routine biochemical procedures. $12,500 is requested for supplies which would
appear to be an underestimate of needs, and $4000 for other expenses.

PROPOSAL. In the prior granting period the P.[. has explored differences between control
and familial Alzheimer‘s disease (AD) ﬁbroblasts with regard to premature senescence and
has made the intriguing observation that Type I interferon (IFN)-induced 2‘5A synthetase
activity is aberrant in familial AD. The enzyme exists in 2 lower mw forms of 40 and 46
kD derived from the same gene by alternative splicing and a 100 10 form probably derived
from a different gene. The enzyme acting through 2~5A converts later RNAase L to its
active form which then degrades viral and cellular RNA. 2-5A synthetase is believed to be
of critical importance in body defense against picomaviruses. In 5 familial AD case
ﬁbroblast lines IFN fails to induce the 40 ltD 2-5A synthetase and the mRNA is not made
suggesting either an aberrancy in synthetase gene promoter or other 5' exon sequences in
familial AD. He has evidence that the 2-5A synthetase gene is hypomethylated in AD cells
suggesting an altered DNA structure for certain genes in AD because of an altered
methylation state which predisposes to changed genetic transcription and/or processing.
The problem does not reside at the level of IFN binding which has been shown to be
normal for o. 3, and 1AIFN in AD cells. Synthetase in AD cells has an acidic pH optimum
whereas in control cells activity is maximal at alkaline pH. Presumably this reﬂects
preferential expression of the 46 kD form in AD, the absence of the 40 id) form and a
reduced expression of the 100 kD form. Surprisingly, at least to this reviewer, RNAase L
activity is reported as increased in AD cells. Based on studies taking advantage of
hyperthermia which regulates synthetase mRNA levels by stabilizing mRNA and of phorbol
esters which augment IFN-induced synthetase induction of synthetase the Pi. has satisﬁed
himself that a post-transcriptional mechanism is not implicated in the altered expression
of synthetase mRNA in AD. Rather he favors differential processing at the 3’ end of the
primary transcript which depends on availability of a proximal or a distal polyadenyletion
site. An alternative would be a different promoter. Based on these data the PJ.
hypothesizes that AD is characterized by an altered DNA methylation state and plans to test
the effects of methylation modulators such as 5-azacytidine and ethionine on control and
AD cells to determine whether control cells can be made to mimic the AD state. He also
proposes to characterize proteins that bind to DNA containing CPGS in control and AD cells
in the presence or absence of IFN. Finally he will measure DNA methyl transferase if time
pemuts.

Expression, Characterization, and Tissue Distribution of a New
Cellular Selenium-dependent Glutathione Peroxidase, GSHPx-GI*

Duarte, California 910M]

We have characterized a new selenium-dependent
glutathione peroxidase, GSHPx—GI, by expressing a
GSHPx-GI cDNA isolated from human hepatoma
IIepG2 cells in human mammary carcinoma MCF-7
cells, which have virtually undetectable expression of
either the classical cellular enzyme, GSHPx-l, or
GSHPx-GI at the protein level. One of the G418-re-
sistant clones, neo-Dl, expresses the transfected
GSIlPx-GI cDNA. This is based on 1) the presence of
an additional GSllPx-GI DNA restriction fragment
detected by Southern analysis; 2) the presence of a 1.9-
kilobase (kb) GSHPx-GI mRNA in addition to the 1.0-
kb endogenous mRNA by Northern analysis; and 3) the
appearance of a 22-kDa 75Se-labclcd protein which is
absent in parental MOE-7 cells revealed by SDS—poly-
acrylamide gel electrophoresis.

GSHPx—GI expressed in neo-D] is a tctrameric pro~
tein localized in cytosol. GSIIPx-GI does not cross-
react with antisera against human GSHPx-l or human
plasma glutathione peroxidase (GSHPx-P). Similar
substrate specificities are found for GSHPx-l and
GSHPx-GI; they both catalyze the reduction of H202,
tert-butyl hydroperoxide, cumene hydroperoxide, and
linoleic acid hydroperoxide with glutathione, but not
of phosphatidylcholine hydroperoxide. GSHPx—GI
mRNA was readily detected in human liver and colon,
and occasionally in human breast samples, but not
other human tissues including kidney, heart, lung, pla-
centa, or uterus. In rodent tissues, GSHPx-GI mRNA
is only detected in the gastrointestinal tract, and not
in other tissues including liver. In fact, GSHl—‘x-GI
appears to be the major glutathione-dependent perox-
idase activity in rodent GI tract. This finding suggests
that GSHPx-GI could play a major role in protecting
mammals from the toxicity of ingested lipid hydroper—
oxides.

In conclusion, we have demonstrated that GSHPx-
GI is the fourth member in the selenium-dependent
glutathione peroxidase family, in addition to GSHPX-
1, GSHPx-P, and phospholipid hydroperoxide gluta-
thione peroxidase (PHGPX).

Selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase activity is due
to the expression of multiple isozymes. Three of the isozymes
have been previously purified and characterized at the protein
level. They are: (a) the classical cellular glutathione peroxi»
dase, GSl-IPx-l‘ (] ). lb) the phospholipid hydroperoxide glu-
tathione peroxidase, l’HGPX [2), and (c) the plasma glutar
thione peroxidase, GSHPx-P (3, 4). Both GSHde and
GSHI’x-P are tetramers and have similar substrate speciﬁci-
ties, They can metabolize H203 and fatty acid hydroperoxides
effectively but metabolize phospholipid hydroperoxide and
cholesterol hydroperoxide poorly [5, 6). On the other hand,
PllG PX is a monomer and has different substrate speciﬁcities
compared to GSHde and GSHPx-P. PHGPX catalyzes the
reduction of phospholipid hydroperoxide, cholesterol hydro»
peroxide, and linoleic acid hydroperoxide much more eft‘ecr
tively than the reduction oil—130.3 and lert-butyl hydroperoxr
ide.

GSHI’Xrl and PllCPX are present in most of the tissues
that have been examined. GSHl’x—l is present abundantly in
erythrocytes, kidney, and liver (7); and I’HGPX is present in
testis at a high level [8). On the other hand, GSHPX’P exhibits
tissuerspccific expression: it is detected in plasma milk, and
lung (:5, 4, 9, 10). in humans, GSHl’x—P mRNA is expre; ed
in liver, kidney, heart, lung, placenta, and breast tis 1e:
whereas, in the rodent GSHl’x-P is not expressed in liver.
although rodent kidney has a higher level of expression which
may compensate for no GSHPxP expression in liver (11).
The cDNA sequence of these three glutathione peroxidase
isozymes have been previously reported; they all contain a
UGA codon coding for selenocysteine (l2—15l,

in addition to these three isczymes, a 24rkl)a epididymal
secretory protein homologous to glutathione peroxidase has
been reported in mouse. This 24rkDa protein is inducible by
testosterone. and it is only expressed in epididymis (16, 17].
Since the published nucleic acid sequence of the 24kDa
protein does not contain a UGA codon, whether it should be
included as an isozyme ot‘ the selenium-dependent glutathione
peroxidases is debatable.

We isolated a GSHPXGI clone from human liver and
human hepatoma HepG2 CDNA libraries in Aglll; this (‘DNA
shares sequence homology with (‘xSl-lPx-J. [18]. The CDNA
clone, GSHl‘x»Gl, was subsequently reported by Akasaka cf
(11. (19], who also isolated it from a human liver library.
GSHerGl CDNA contains a UGA codon; this suggests that
it may be a fourth seleniunrdependent glutathione peroxidase
isozyme. Because the protein product of GSl—lPx-Gl had not
been identiﬁed, it was possible that GSllerGI was a psetlr
dogene. In this report, we present data on the analysis of

THE 1986 BERNARD B. BRODIE AWARD LECTURE

The Genetic Regulation of Drug-Metabolizing Enzymes

DANIEL W. NEBERT

Chief, Laboratory of Developmental Pharmacology, National Institute a! Child Health and Human Development, National Institutes of Health

I feel very honored, indeed, and also very humble, to have the
privilege of joining my four esteemed colleagues (lv4) in being
named as recipient of the ﬁfth Bernard B. Brodie Award in Drug
Metabolism. I thank the American Society for Pharmacology
and Experimental Therapeutics (administrators of this award)
and the CIBA-GEIGY Corp. (sponsors of this award) for their
recognition of my studies on the genetic regulation of drug-
mctabolizing enzymes. My training began in the laboratories of
Howard S. Mason, and then Harry Gelboin, who both helped
me in choosing the direction of my future studies. I am thankful
for my association during the subsequent 18 years with numerous
talented colleagues and collaborators without whose skill, hard
work, creativity, and continued support and friendship the work
I am about to describe would not have been possible. Although
their contributions are well documented in the literature, there
are several individuals whose contributions are not. One of these
is Ernst Caspari, in 1959 with The Department of Biology,
Wesleyan University, Middletown CT, who inspired me to think
that “there can be little sense to biology, except in the context of
genetics and evolution.“ Two others include Mort B. Lipsett,
previous Director of the National Institute of Child Health and
Human Development (NICHHD), and Arthur S. Levine, Sci-
entiﬁc Director of the NICHHD, who helped create the environ-
ment needed for the pursuit of innovative basic research, The
other individual is my wife, Kathleen Dixon, who has critically
reviewed many of my publications since 1981, and who gave
birth to two beautiful, healthy twin boys the same day that John
Schenkman informed me of my being recipient of the Brodie
Award.

This paper is directed at the graduate student and beginning
postdoctoral fellow. I wish to illustrate the chain of events in my
career—how the thinking in my laboratory led to the design of
an experiment, and how our interpretation of new data led to
the next hypothesis. At each point in time, of course, develop»
ment of the next experiment was heavily inﬂuenced by the
prevalent thinking, the skill and creativity of my postdoctoral
fellows and collaborators, and the techniques available.

Genetic Locus Deﬁned. The metabolism of carcinogenic poly-
cyclic hydrocarbons, such as benzo[a]pyrene, was known 2 dec-
ades ago to be carried out by a P-450 enzyme, aryl hydrocarbon
hydroxylase (AHH).l We had found that it was possible to study
in cell culture the regulation of AHH activity—including induc-
tion by benzo[a]anthraoene, cycloheximide, and actinomycin D
(5—9). The induction, by polycyclic hydrocarbons, of an enzyme
that metabolized polycyclic hydrocarbons, seemed very exciting
because of its relevance to human environmentally caused cancer

This paper is dedicated to the memory ol Mort B. Lipsett (1921—1985). whose
enthusiastic support as a friend and administrator I shall never target.

‘ Abbreviations used are: AHH. aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase; BP, benzo[a]

restriction fragment length polymorphism

and toxicity. The induction of an enzyme by many of its sub-
strates also appeared to be very important in fundamental studies
of eukaryotic gene regulation.

A survey of AHH inducibility among several inbred mouse
strains (l0) therefore “seemed like a neat idea" for several rea-
sons. (i) As Severe Ochoa noted, “All things being equal, it is
better to have a biologic mutant than not to have a biologic
mutant.” (ii) In 1969, carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, and toxicity
were just beginning to be measurable in tissue culture. The intact
mouse thus promised to be a better model for the study of
pathophysiologic effects of environmental chemicals. (iii) The
observations of genetic differences in the mouse can most likely
be extrapolated to human disease caused by the metabolism of
environmental carcinogens and toxic chemicals. A survey of
several inbred mouse strains (10) revealed a fundamental differ-
ence (table 1) between CS7BL/6 (136) and DEA/2 (D2) mice. 3-
Methylcholanthrene (MC) treatment increased hepatic AHH
activity more than 6-fold in B6 but not D2 mice. A 2-nm spectral
shift in the reduced P-450-C0 complex was also seen in MC-
treated 36 but not D2 mice. The B6-D2 difference was not
observed following phenobarbital treatment. One interpretation
of the table 1 data is that MC treatment of 86 but not D2 mice
might lead to the appearance, or large increase, of at least one
new P—450 protein; alternatively, MC might cause a decrease in
one or more other proteins, unmasking an already existing P-
450 protein in BG but not D2 mice. Why does the BG mouse,
when presented with a polycyclic hydorcarbon stimulus, respond
with an increase in polycyclic hydrocarbon metabolism while
the D2 mouse does not? The rest of my career to date has been
devoted to gaining a better understanding of this observation.

We ﬁrst wondered what would happen if the genetically “re-
sponsive” Bo mouse were crossed with the genetically “nonres-
ponsive” D2 mouse. The lack of AHH induction was found to

was active in the T-cell assay and well separated from the void peak (which might contain
undigested material) was further fractionated by HPLC using a C18 reverse phase column.
An active peak was then fractionated on a high resolution ion exchange column (Dionex,
Omnipac NA—l 00), yielding six peaks. 5 of which were extremely sharp. Only one peak
was active in the T-cell assay. Laser ionization mass spectroscopy by Dr. Brian Chait.
Rockefeller University, revealed that this peak consisted of an incomplete digestion prod-
not having a molecular weight of 8612. Only a single molecular weight species was
detected. N—tenninal sequencing of the ﬁrst 10 residues in the Howard Hughes Protein
Core facility revealed a single sequence (xxLxxIxFQT) which was sufﬁcient to identify the
N-terminus of the ovalbumin peptide (ova 127). On the assumption that lysine was essen-
tial (based on data not shown) . ova 185-207 was synthesized and found to be active. We
are now synthesizing additional peptides to determine the boundaries of the epitope.
Second. we have begun a determination of the v-region sequences of the B-lymphom'a hy-
bridoma (41—6.A7(IB9)). PCR ampliﬁed v-region cDNA has been ligated into a commer-
cial vector . Clones with inserts of the correct size have been sequenced in the Cancer Cen-
ter core facility. The heavy chain v-region sequence of the B-lymphoma fusion partner
(A20.2J.PF) has been completed in this laboratory. To continue this work, we have begun a
collaboration with Dr. Inghirami. a coinvestigator on this application, who has extensive
experience with v—region sequencing. When the v-region sequences of the B-lymphoma
hybrid are in hand, synthetic peptides based on these sequences will be tested with the T-
cell hybridoma. If our hypothesis is correct, one of the vvregion peptides should stimulate
the ova~speciﬁc T hybrid. -

Aims.
The ﬁrst aim will be to complete the characterization of the ova epitope recognized
by 32—6.F12. using synthetic peptides. ‘

A second aim is to sequence the v-regions of the putative residue internal image B-
lymphoma hybrid 41-6.A6(l.B9) in order to prepare synthetic Varegion peptides. The resi-

due intemal image assignment requires the identiﬁcation of a synthetic v-region peptide
that is stimulatory fer 32-6.Fl2.

A third aim will be to test our hypothesis that T-cell recognized internal images play
a role in physiologic responses to foreign antigens. We will study fusions prepared with

splenocytes from unimmunized mice and mice undergoing primary and secondary respons-
es to ovalbumm. .

A fourth aim will be to determine the degree of sequence homology between v-re-
gion and ova peptides that is required for functional imagery. This is of great interest since

the frequency of residue internal images in the repertoire wrll depend on the degree of
homology required. - -

Budget: I estimate that this project can be completed in 3 years with annual direct costs of
approru'mately $85,000. -

”BSTRACT

 

Biochemical antagonism between heparin and ascorbic acid was
described (Owen et. al., 1970). Ascorbic acid is found in high
concentrations in adrenal and testicular tissue-and plays an
important role in steroid synthesis in these tissues. To determine
5 ts antagonism
with ascorbic acid, levels of testosterone were s ice in testiw
cular tissue of adult male Syrian golden hamsters and in testicular
plasma of adult male Sprague—Dawley rats during heparin treatment.

To determine concentrations of testosterone in tissue the
double isotope derivative assay method was used. Radioimiunoassay
was used to determine testosterone concentrations in plasma. No
inhibitory effect was detected when testosterone concentrations in

e-the treated groups were compared with those in the control groups.

The interplay of sex hormones has been known to be associated
with ascorbic acid metabolism in various animals. Testosterone~
administration to castrated male albino rats was found to restore
hepatic contents of ascorbic acid metabolites to the sham control

‘ Role of Chemical Reagents in the Activation of Rat Hepatic

Glucocorticoid-Receptor Complex*

The eﬁ'ect of sulfbydryl modifying reagents on the
activation of hepatic glucoeorticoid—receptor complex
was studied. Unactivated (preincubated at 0°C) [’11]-
dexamethnsone-receptor complex pretreated with N-
etbylmnleimide or iodoacetanu'de at 0°C and then
treated at 25°C was unable to bind to rat liver nuclei.
0n the other hand, [‘Hldexamethasone-receptor com-
plex ﬁrst incubated at 25°C and then treated with N-
ethylmsleimide or iodoacetamide showed marked bind-
ing to nuclei. comparable to that obtained with acti-
vated cytosol. The results suggest that sulfbydryl mod-
ifying reagents act at the level of motivated glucocor-
ticoidreccptor complex. blocking its activation and
binding to nuclei.

It was previously shown that pyridoxal phosphate
inhibits the binding 0 "activated” dexmnethasone-re-
ceptor complexes to DNA-cellulose in oitm (Cake, M.
H., DiSorbo, D. M., and Litwack. G. (1978) J. Biol. Chem.
253, 4886—4891). We have characterized both the N-
ethylmaleimide-treated and the pyridoxal phosphate-
treated [’mdexamethasone-receptor complexes by
agarose gel ﬁltration and sucrose-gradient centrifuga-
tion; we found that whereas pyridoxal phosphate-
treated cytosol at NC showed a considerable amount
of a smaller fragment of the receptor that was unable
to bind to nucch N-ctbylmalcimidc-h'eated cytosol was
totally devoid of this smaller fragment, and resembled
untreated, unactivated cytosol. The sulfhydryl modify-
ing reagents would appear to lock the receptor into an
intact unactivntcd form as opposed to pyridoxal phos-
phate that degrades the molecule into smaller units.
Thus. N-ethylmalcimide treatment may be valuable in

the puriﬁcation of the unactivated form of the receptor
to homogeneity.

 

The formation of the glucocorticoid-receptor complex in
the cytoplasm of the target cells for the hormone, and its
activation and translocation to the nuclear acceptor sites, are
believed to be of primary importance in the induction of
certain enzymes in hepatoma and liver cells (1—3). We have
shown previously that the binding of glucocorticoids to the
receptor proteins is markedly inhibited by treatment of the
rat liver Cytosol with various sulfhydryl modifying reagents
(4). Subsequently, Young et al. (5). using mouse mammary
tumors and hamster kidney (BHK) cell lines. observed that

sullhydryl modifying reagents not only inhibit the binding of
glucocorticoids to the receptor proteins but also inhibit the
binding of preformed hormone—receptor complex to DNA. It
was not clear, however, whether sulfhydryl reagents block the
activation of glucocorticoid receptor-complex or its subse-
quent binding to nuclear receptor sites. Although some un—
derstanding has been achieved concerning the phenomenon
of temperature-dependent activation of rat liver glucocorti-
acid-receptor complex. the precise mechanism of in vitro
activation is not yet known (6—10). The present paper reports
evidence suggesting that sulfhydryl reagents block the acti~
vation of the glucocorticoid-receptor complex ( per se) and not
its subsequent binding in nuclear acceptor sites.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES

Methods

Moterials—[LZL’HIDexsmethssone (31 Ci/mmol) was obtained
from New England Nuclear. with radiochemical purity periodically
checked by thin layer chromatography as described previously (ll).
Nonradloactive dexamethssone, pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, ﬁ~mercap-
methanol, and iuduacetamide were purchased from Sigma. N~ethyl~
maleimide was obtained from Flulta AG Chemische Fabrik, SwiL-Leh
land.

Male Sprague~Dswley rats (from Charles River Breeding Labora—
tories). 150 to 200 g, were adrenaleotomized bilaterally 7 to 9 days
beiore use and were maintained on standard Purina Chow, 0.9% NaCl
solution, and water ad libitum.

Preparation of CytasoliAnin-ials were killed by eenical disloca-
tion, and the livers were perfused in situ with ice-cold TS buffer (10
mu Tris~HCL 0.25 M sucrose, pH 7.5) and homogenized in a solution
(1:2, w/v) of the same buffer, The homogenates were ﬁltered through
cheesecloth and centrifuged at 2.000 X g in a Sorvall SS 34 rotor at
2°C for 10 min to sediment a crude nucleur pellet. The cytosol fraction
was prepared by centrifuging the homogenate at 240,000 x g for 60
min at 04°C. The upper fatty layer was discarded and the cytoaul
was carefully removed and used for steroid binding studies The
cytosol was diluted to yield a protein concentration of approximately
Z) lug/ml. The cytosol was then incubated with 5 X lo“ M ["H]-
dexsmethasone in the presence or absence of a lmfold excess of
nonradioactive deumetbssnne. After incubation for 2 h at 0°C to
allow maximal binding. the speciﬁc macromolecular-bound fraction
of steroid was determined using the charcoalvdextran technique (12).

Treatment of Cytosal with Chemical Reagents~ Pyridoxal 5’-phos-
pbste, iodoacemnide. and N—cthylmaleimxde were prepared in con-
centrated stock solutions (100 mu. pH 7.5) prior to use in the
experiments. Cytosol containing pyridoxal 5’~phosphste, iodoaceta-
mlde, or N-ethylmaleimide was incubated for 30 min at 0°C in the
dark.

Nuclear Binding Assay—Nuclei were puriﬁed from the 2.000 x g
pellet using 1.8 M sucrose in 10 mm Tris pH 1.5, containing 0.025 M
KCl and 3 mm MgClz as previously described (13]. The washed nun-lei
were suspended in homogeniution buffer. Aliquots of the nuclear
suspension containing 50 pg of DNA were centrifuged at 2.000 x g
for 5 min at 0°C and the supernatant fractiom were discarded.
[’H]Dexamethasone-treated cytoaol 10.2 ml) was added and a ﬁnal
volume of 1 ml of reaction mixture was made by Addition of homo;~
cnimtion buffer. The nuclei were resuspended by gently stirring with
a Vortex mixer, and the suspension was incubated for 30 min at 0°C.
Following incubation, the nuclei were removed by centrifugation at

while the proportion of young females smoking has increased two-foldz.
Most educational and persuasi e programs in public schools do not appear
to deter the onset of smoking . The recognition that narrow strategies
of prevention are not effective has led researchers to probe the problem
more carefully in search of the critical social and psychological factors ’
and processes which determine the onset of smoking4'-. Notions of how and
why adolescents start smokigg have yielded some promising early results in
recent intervention studies '4' , but despite considerable attention to the
subject, no comprehensive model of the onset of smoking has been articulated

m
E

i
. Comprehensive reviews of the literatureev9 list many different variables
’ that have been associated with smoking among adolescents, but these vari-
ables are usually only categorized rather than constructed into a general

explanatory model. Individual research reports have tended to concentrate

on only a few of the factors that may be directly related to smoking rather
than complex models of direct, indirect, and interactive effects. Thus,

our understanding of how and why young people become habitual cigarette
smokers has remained at a fairly basic level.

ﬂ
Investigators studying adolescent alcohol and drug use, behaviors which"
are strongly correlated with cigarette smokinglo, have proposed and re-
searched models of the onset of those behaviors, but they have tended E0
be more descriptive than explanatory. For example, Jessor and Jessor1
show that marijuana use is correlated with a lack of conventional social

13 and personal values and control. Similar findings are reported with

I respect to alcohollz. Kandel (1975)13 proposes stages of adolescent
involvement in the use of various substances and provides data which

1E: show that experimentation with cigarettes, beer, and wine usually pre-
cedes the use of stronger licit and illicit substances. Smith and Fogg

(1978)l4 focus on the role of personality and find that those who smoke

in! and use drugs do not conform to adult expectations regarding obedience
and self-control. Thus, this line of inquiry has been relatively unsuc-

cessful at generating an explanatory model of substance-use onset.

n In this paper we will present a general model describing the causes of

cigarette smoking and describe some studies undertaken to validate the
model.

smcr: rrs [uncommon in 1967 by Rudolph and Hey-
mann ( 13). the microsphere method has been extensively
used because of its simplicity and the possibility of de-
termining regional as well as systemic blood ﬂow even in
small animals like rats (7-9, ll, 14). However. the accu-
racy of results from microsphere injections depends hm-
damentally on the uniform mixing of microspheres in the
bloodstream; in that respect the site of injection may be
critical, particularly for coronary blood ﬂow measure-
ments. Because of alleged difﬁculties of left-atrial cathe-
terization. most studies of rats have utilized a left-ven-
tricular approach, assuming in the process that mixing
was adequate (7. 9. 12, 14). However. experiments in dogs
have shown that leﬁoventricular injections give less de-
pendable results and more marked differences in the
distribution of microspheres to the heart than injections
into the left atrium (2, 5). Moreover our preliminary
experiments in rats did show a high variability of coro-
nary blood ﬂow measurements with left-ventricular in-
jections. We therefore developed a technique of left-atrial
catheterization in rats that could be perforrhed with no
major technical difﬁculties. This allowed us to compare
the variability of blood flow determinations made by left-
atrial injections with that of measurements obtained by
left~ventricle injection. as regards systemic (cardiac out-

H94

put) and regional (coronary, renal, cerebral) ﬂows. The
results show that I) intro-atrial injections lead more
consistently to adequate dispersion of the microspheres
in the aortic root than do intraventricular injections and
2) the intra-atrial—injection technique must be preferred
for precise determinations of coronary blood flow because
of the lower variability resulting from better mixing of
the microspheres.

METHODS

Experiments were carried out in anesthetized rats sep-
arated into two groups. in group A (n = 10) the micro-
spheres were injected ﬁrst into the left atrium and sub-
sequently into the left ventricle. In group B (n = 10) the
left~ventricular injection was performed ﬁrst followed by
the intro-atrial injection. The sequence of studies was
regularly alternated so that one animal of group A (left-
atrial injection ﬁrst) was followed by one of group B
(left-ventricular injection ﬁrst).

Preparation of rats. Sprague-Dawley rats were anes-
thetized with pentobarbital sodium (30 mg/kg ip), and
anesthesia was subsequently maintained with small doses
(6-10 mg/kg ip) given as required approximately every
30—45 min The rats were intubated through the mouth
and ventilated with room air. The same surgical sequence
was used in all animals whatever the order of injection.

First, a catheter was positioned in the left at rium. The
lematrial appendage was exposed by thoracotomy
through the third left intdrcostal space, the pericardium

Oaaracterization of the Proteins which are Closely Associated with Ligand-
Receptor Conplex in the Clathrin-Coated Structures in Huron KB Carcinoma
Cells.

Recently, the concept of toxin-unnocloml antibody conjugates sewing
as potential chenotheraputic agents has been shown to be experimentally
feasible. Several laboratories have successfully coupled cytotoxin
molecules to monoclonal antibodies or ligands that bind to specific cell
surface determinants or receptors. However, of major concern now is the
developnent of effective means to increase the intracellular half life and
intracellular toxicity of these cytotoxic conjugates. Since most proteins
after internalization by cells have been shown to be canparunentalized,
isolated fran cytoplasm, and subsequently degraded in the lysoscmes, the
half life and toxicity of the cytotoxic conjugates would be greatly impaired
if these compounds followed this common intracellular pathway after
internalization. Imus, the development of a toxin-carrier which allows
cytotoxic conjugates to bypass lysomal degradation and effectively pass
into the cytoplasm has beomne an important subject in the developnent of
chemotheraputic agents. To approach this problem, understanding the
structure of clathrin-coated pits would be an appropriated begining at the
present time.

A primary observation frun Ira Pastan's laboratory has been shown that
epidermal growth factor (ass) and transferrin (TE) could be found in plasma
membrane coated pits (primary coated pits) at 6 min after ligand
internalization. At 22 min BGF was localized in Golgi coated pits
(secondary coated pits) while '13? was localized in microtubule associated
vesicles. This observation clearly indicated that clathrin-coated
structures might play sane role in the sorting of internalized ligands. In
addition, some receptors, such as those for BGE‘ and TF, are randomly
distributed on the cell surface in the absence of lignd and only becane
concentrated (clustered) in coated pits in the presence of ligand. 'lhis
also indicates that coated pits can aggregate certain ligand—receptor
canplexes rather than unoccupied receptors. In order to have these sorting
processes, cells must have some specific proteins involved in these
processes. If it is the case, I believe that these specific proteins
involved in sorting ligand-receptor cunplenes must be closely associated
with the ligand-receptor cmuplex. lb draracterize these specific proteins,
the following experiments are proposed.

associated with ligand—receptor canplex in the clathrin-coated structujr 5.
Experiments will be carried out to allow cells preincubated with S-
methionine overnight to take up see and us. At various time after uptake,
cells will be homogenized and clathrin-coated vesicles will be
inmmoadsorbed on anticlathrin-Stamlococcus aureus. 'ihe isolated clathrin-
coated vesicles will then react with bifunctional cross-linker, sum as the
noncleabable cross-linker disuccinimidyl suberate (DIS), followed by
irmumom-ecipitation with anti mﬁreceptor antibody or anti TF-receptor
antibody. 'lhe immprecipitates will then be characterized on Sits-PAGE,

followed by autoradiography. If there is any specific protein closely

CHANGES IN TRANSMURAL CENTRAL VENOUS PRESSURE IN

We demonstrated that large airrlounts of blood
shift from the forearm veins during hy-pcrirentila-
lion (2). If this effect were géneralized in the
periphery of the body the volume of blood in the
central venous reservoir might increase. An in-
creaSc in pressure in the central veins would be
evidence to support this suggestion. The fall in
peripheral venous pressure which occurs during
hyperventilation (2. 3), however, implies that
central venous pressure also decreases. This
makes our thesis less attractive. Still, the trans.
mural pressure (4). the net pressure acting to dis-
tend the central veins, could t'ncrcate during over-
breathing if the pressure surrounding the veins
(intrapleural pressure) decreased more than did
the pressure within them.

This study was undertaken to assess the nature
and magnitude of changes in mean transmum!
central venous pressure during hyperventilation
and to see whether the changes were consistent
with our suggestion that blood shifts centrally

during overbreathing.

Kinetics of Transfer of Pyrene and

rac—l-Oleyl-Z-[4-( 3-pyrenyl)butanoyl]glycerol between Human Plasma

Lipoproteinsl

Steven C. Charltont and Louis C. Smith*

ABSTRACT: Control of lipid transfer between plasma lipo-
proteins has been studied with pyrene and a pyrcne-containing
diglyceride analogue, rac-1-oleyl-2-[4-(3-pyrenyl)butanoyl]-
glycerol. The rate constants for transfer of the ﬂuorescent
probes between high-density lipoproteins in dilute solutions
containing ions of the Hofmeister series are correlated with
the molal surface tension increments produced by this lyotropic
series. Moreover, the rates of transfer correlate well with the
aqueous solubilities of the hydrophobic compounds, which were
increased in dilute solutions containing organic solvents. The
rates of transfer are faster with an increase in the distribution
coefﬁcients of the probes between the lipoprotein donor and
the aqueous phase, suggesting that the ratedetermining process
can be considered simply as a partitioning between two im—
miscible solvents. Rate constants for transfer of pyrene be-
tween high~deusity, low-density, and very low density lipo-
proteins depend on the ratio of the donor/ acceptor lipoprotein

Bast-ha lipoproteins function as circulating reservoirs for a

wide variety of hydrophobic substances that have extremely
low solubility in aqueous solutions (Smith et al., 1978; Scanu
et al., 1979), These compounds include triglyceride, chole—
sterol, cholesteryl ester, and phosphatidylcholine as major
components and minor amounts of lipid-soluble vitamins and

. environmentally derived contaminants.

The relatively constant compositions of the circulating li-
poproteins result from ﬁve simultaneous processes: (I) syn-
thesis and secretion, (2) passive transfer and exchange of lipid

concentrations and agree with those predicted from the dis-
tribution coefﬁcients. In addition, the rate of transfer is in-
versely related to the lipoprotein radius, with a linear corre-
lation observed between the log of the rate constant and l /
radius. By analogy with the evaporation of liquid droplets
described by Kelvin’s law, the transfer of a lipid from a li—
poprotein or a membrane surface can be described as kdote'W’
where K is a constant, 1r is the interfacial surface pressure of
a curved surface of a radius r, and k, is the dissociation
constant. These results show that the rate of transfer of lipids
can be modiﬁed by changes in the solubility of the transferring
species in the aqueous phase and imply that other factors, such
as solubility of the transferring species in the membrane and
the properties of the lipid—protein surface, may have important
roles in regulating the kinetics of lipid transfer in biological
systems.

and apoprotein components, (3) active transfer involving
speciﬁc plasma exchange proteins, (4) enzymatic changes in
composition involving lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase and
lipoprotein lipase, and (5) removal from circulation by cellular
uptake of lipid and apoprotein components. The dynamics and
the contribution of each process to overall lipoprotein me-
tabolism are poorly defined.

All lipoproteins contain proteins, cholesterol, and phos-
pholipids in a surface ﬁlm that surrounds a neutral lipid core
of choiesteryl ester and triglyceride (Shen et a1., 1977). Li-
poprotein surfaces have the dynamic properties of a two-di-
mensional fluid, in which there are rapid nonoovalent inter—
actions between individual lipid and protein components, in-
volving both rotational motion and translational diffusion in
the surface (Lee, I975; Thompson & Huang, 1978). Because
the lipid components of lipoproteins are soluble in the aqueous
solution to some extent, they also partition between the lipo-
protein surface and the aqueous solution (Charlton et al., 1976,
1978a). Since some lipoprotein components transfer on time
scales (milliseconds to hours) that are much shorter than the

ABSTRACT

In a recent paper based upon repeated magnetization
studies done on the lungs of smokers and non-smokers who
have inhaled small quantities of iron oxide powder, Cohen
et al claim that the dust clearance ability of the ciga-
rette smoker's lung is markedly impaired. A re-inter-
pretation of this data which casts serious doubt on the
logic of Cohen's conclusion was suggested by sterling and
is based upon the hypothesis that during the magnet—
ization phase of Cohen's experiment. iron oxide "clus-
ters' were preferentially formed in the highly mucous-
filled environment of the smoker's bronchi.

In order to test this hypothesis. in-vitro experi-
ments have been performed to measure the mean "cluster“I
diameter of iron oxide powder in a mucous-like liquid
medium (methylcellulose) during and after magnetization
as functions of the solution viscosity. Results of these
measurements will be presented.

in a recent paper based upon the results of magnet-
ization studies of the lungs of smokers and non-smokers.
Cohen et al(1) stated that the dust clearance ability of
the cigarette smokers' lungs is markedly impaired. Con-
siderable doubt has been cast on this conclusion by
Sterling(2) who has re-interpreted Cohen's magnetization
data using the hypothesis that magnetic clusters were
fonned preferentially in smokers' bronchi. due to the
presence of excessive sputun.(a) In order to test this
new hypothesis in-vitro. experiments have been performed
to measure the diameter of iron oxide fstrings' and
clusters formed in a mucous or sputum-like median after
magnetization.

it is clear that the validity of Cohen's conclusion
hinges upon the assumption that the iron oxide dust which
remains in the subjects' lungs after the magnetization
procedure, has identical physical characteristics in both
smokers and non-smokers. While there is no simple way to
demonstrate the truth of this assumption in-vivo. it is
possible to show in-vitro that it is false and that. in
fact. the experimental procedure itself may cause the
iron oxide dust in smokers' lungs to form clusters which
cannot be easily cleared.

An inhibitory carboxyl-terminal domain in Ets—l and Ets-2 mediates
differential binding of ETS family factors to promoter sequences of

the mb-I gene

(DNA-binding proteins/Beell-speciﬁc gene expression)

ABSTRACT The mb-I gene is expressed only during the
early stages of B-Iymphocyte differentiation. Here we show that
the "lb-1 proximal promoter region contains a functionally
important binding site for members of the ETS family of
DNA-binding proteins. We found that both the E26 virus-
encoded v-ets and the myeloid/B-cell-specliic factor PU. l hind
efficiently to this site in via-o. By contrast, Ets- , the lympho-
cyte-specific cellular homologue of v-ets. and the related, more
ubiquitously expressed Ets-Z protein interacted weakly with
this binding site. DNA binding by both Ets-l and Ets-Z,
however, could be increased 20- to 50-fold by deleting as few
as 16 carboxyI-terminal amino acids. The inhibitory carboxyl-
terminal amino acid sequence is highly conserved between
Ets-l and Ets-2 but is not present in either v—ets or PU.1.
Replacement of the carboxyl-terminal amino acids of v-ets with
thm of Eur-1 decreased DNA binding by v-ets drastically.
Cotrapslatlon of Ets-l transcripts encoding proteins of differ-
ent lengths suggested that Ets-l binds DNA as a monomer.
Therefore, the carboxyl-terminal inhibitory domain appears to
interfere directly with DNA binding and not with homodimer-
tuition. Finally, the functional relevance of ETS factor binding
to the nib-l promoter site was evidenced by the stimulation of
ti'acscription through this site by a v-myb—v-ets fusion protein.
Together, these data suggest that one or more ETS family
factors are involved in the regulation of mb-I gene expression.

 

The B-lymphocyte—speciﬁc nib-1 gene is a model for the
regulation of lineage- and stage-speciﬁc gene expression. The
mb-I gene encodes a 32-kDa protein that is required for the
expression of IgM molecules on the B-cell surface (for
review, see ref. 1). Speciﬁc mb-l transcripts have been found
only in cells that comprise the early stages of B-lymphoid-celi
differentiation (2). Tissue culture transfectioo experiments
suggested that proximal mb—I promoter sequences residing
between nucleotides —68 to +70 contain sufficient informa-
tion for early B-cell-specit'ic gene expression (3). Analysis of
linker scanning and deletion mutations across this region
indicated the importance of at least two distinct nuclear
factor-binding sites for mb—I promoterfunction (3). Both sites
were shown to interact with ubiquitous factors in virro. One
factor was identiﬁed as Spl, whereas the identity of the
second factor, termed MUF2 (mb-l upstream factor 2), is
unknown. Interestingly, the MUF2 site is identical to a
sequence within the polyornavirus enhancer region (PEA3
site) that is’ recognized by the nuclear DNA-binding protein
Hts-1 in vitro (4). Ets-l, which is expressed primarily in
lymphoid tissues, has been implicated as a tissue-speciﬁc
regulator of transcription (for review, see ref. 5). Therefore,
the question arises as to whether Ets-l or another lymphoid-

speciﬁc factor can bind the MUF2 site and participate in the
regulation of mb—l gene expression.

The ETS family of nuclear proteins is characterized by a
conserved DNA-binding motif referred to as the ETS domain
(6). Two members of the ETS family, the B- and T-cell-
speciﬁc Ets—l and myeloid/B—cell-speciﬁc PU.1 proteins, are
expressed in a cell-type-speciﬁc manner that suggests a role
in the regulation of lymphoid-speciﬁc genes (7-11). By con-
trast, Ets—Z, which is closely related to Ets-l, is expressed in
a wide range of tissue types and cultured cells (8, 9, 12). The
v-ets polypeptide is encoded by a transduced c-eIr-I gene
expressed by the avian retrovirus E26 as part of a tripartite
fusion protein. plil53“9"""""‘s (13, 14).

Here we report that Ets-l and PU.1 bind the mb-I promoter
in vitro, although with different efficiencies. We show that
this differential DNA binding is governed by the presence of
inhibitory carboxyl-tenninai amino acids in Ets-l and Ets-Z,
which are absent in PU.1 or v—ets.

Spring 1997 — App. #4721 - William A. Pryor, PhD. - Louisiana State
Reviewer (Primary): McAllister
Cigarette Smoke, Beta—Carotene, Alcohol and Cancer

BACKGROUND and PLAN: Pryor is a "living legend" in the world of reactive oxidant
species, particularly those involving free radicals and/or cigarette smoke. For many years, he has
been a proponent of the theory that some low molecular weight water soluble quinone system
radicals in cigarette smoke are responsible for DNA damage, speciﬁcally production of single
strand breaks. Since his tar extract system produces superoxide, hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl
radicals, the mechanism, along with the identity of the radical remains obscure.

Now comes the famous (or infamous) CARET trial (beta-carotene and retinol efficiency
trial) and the ATBC (alpha-tocopherol-beta—carotene for cancer prevention) study in which it was
revealed that smokers had suffered higher rates of lung cancer with beta—carotene
supplementation. This was confounded by the finding that in fact alcohol intake more clearly
correlated with cancer incidence. It has been suggested by some that at high circulating levels of
beta—carotene in the CARET study, cigarette smoke might actually be interacting with that
molecule to generate oxidizing tumor promoters. Pryor believes he is in a unique position to help
unravel this birdsnest of interacting variables. He proposes ﬁve lines of inquiry:

1. Does the aforementioned radical actually cause single strand breaks in DNA? In fact he
has already shown that it does albeit at a tremendously high level of the tar extract.

2. Does his quinone model compound bind to DNA? His model system for these studies is
an aged catechol solution which he has now prepared with carbon—l4. He will ascertain its DNA
binding ability.

3. Does BaP bind to DNA in the presence of tar extract but not microsomes? Does BaP
bind to DNA in the presence of microsomes with or without tar extract? Does the binding differ if
normal or ethanol-induced microsomes are used? When binding occurs, what are the effects of
beta—carotene and alpha tocopherol? He has in fact already demonstrated BaP binding, but it is in
the presence of cigarette tar levels of up to 50:1 weight to weight excess over the DNA target,

Can this be meaningful in any physiological sense?

4. Do the micronutrients beta-carotene or alpha—tocopherol bind to DNA in the presence of
microsomes and/or cigarette tar extract? Does the presence of BaP inﬂuence the binding of these
micronutrients to DNA? With this series of experrnents‘ he hopes to test the hypothesis that
carotenes may react with the radicals and/or oxidants to form species that can add to DNA to give
an adtluct that will then affect the subsequent. binding of BaP. This is another kitchen sink series
of experiments that could take tremendous amounts of time and when the results are extrapolated
hack to in vivo ranges, might or might not have something to do with reality,

5, Do BaP DNA-adducts form in rat hepatocytes exposed to ACT? Are there differences
in BaP DNA/DNA adducts between normal and ethinol~dependent rat hepatocytes? What is the
effect of beta—carotene or alpha—tecopherol? This is actually one of the more interesting questions
that he wants to address and may in fact relate directly to the ethanol ﬁnding in the ATBC study.

OBJECT:

 

To provide the means for the identification and analysis of low
molecular weight syrup fragments in enzyme-hydrolyzed hydroxypropylated
starch.

SUMMARY:>

The possibility was recognized that syrups of enzyme-hydrolyzed
hydroxypropylated starch might be of commercial value. However, prior
to obtaining FDA approval for the sale of such material, a survey of
the low molecular weight fragments to DP4 would have been desired.
Penick & Ford requested an estimate of the effort that might be required
to obtain and develop the methods and information. Preliminary analyses
of typical syrups from Penick & Ford were made using gas chromatography (1)
and thin-layer chromatography (2). The results of this investigation. along
with recommendations for possible paths of approach, were furnished
Penick & Ford. Since then, the decision has been reached by them to

terminate this program.

MEMORANDUM:

Three samples of enzyme degraded hydroxypropyl starch syrups were
prepared by Mr. R. B. Nelson of Penick & Ford from propylene oxide-substituted
corn starch (3). These ranged in D.E. from 14.6 to 16.7%. The base starches
used in the production of these syrups ranged from 1.30 to 4.42% propylene
oxide substitution based on dry substance. The syrups were carbon treated,
ion-exchanged and concentrated to about 80% total solids prior to being

received by us.

Dear Doctor Osdene,

1 BASIC EXPERIMENTAL CONCEPT

The 21 d—inhalation study —/3016 with male rats started on Aug. 13
and ended on Sept. 3, 1979 (last exposure day: Sept. 2, 1979).

This inhalation study was designed to investigate the response
of t e laryngeal epithelium to aerosols of paraffin and DOS

b cic acid-bis(2—ethylhexyl)ester) in doses comparable to TPM
dose ’0. igaret es, ni ere during standard 21 d-smoke
inhalation studies. Other bioassays, the responses of which were

‘investigated, were: spedific AHM activity in liver, kidney, free

lung cells and lavaged lung, specific O-demethylase activity in

liver, kidney and lavaged lung as well as phagocytosis and phago—
luminescence of free lung cells. "

Each group contained 60 rats.

The rats were not exposed on the day of sacrifice. All rats were
starved from 06.00 the day before until sacrifice. Water was
given ad libitum except during exposure.

If applicable, data were tested for statistically significant de—

DATE OF REPORT: September‘26g I960
PROJECT LEADER: W. H. Danker

PROPYLENE GLYGOL IN‘FILLER FOR SMOKE MILDNESS‘

A study has been under way for several months to determine
the maximum amount of propylene glycol we could add toifillers
without staining the paper. BothiAlpine and Philip Morris

cigarettes are being tested - at room temperature and at elevated

temperatures. A range of from 4 ‘to 8% propylene glycol is

being used inithe study. The 8 samples show paper spotting
within a month. The 6% samples show a slight amount of spotting
on Philip Morris cigarettes andifrequent spotting on Alpine ciga-
rettes in 2 months. The h% samples show spotting only at 110°F
after 1 month; samples stored at 75°F did not spot inil month.,

Analysis of propylene glycol has been recently made
relatively much more reliable and show much variation in
application of propylene glycol on filler. Therefore future
panel studies will be more meaningful when accompanied by
analytical data. Our studies will continue until firm results
are determined correlating percentage propylene glycol, spott-
ing and reductioniin irritation.

In the event that spotting does occur at a propylene
glycol level which is thresholdifor irritationu Mr. J. w.
Geiger has a paper whiohihas shown no spotting at the higher
levels of propylene glycol in filler.

SIMULTANEOUS EVALUATIONS OF FLAVOR AND IRRITATION

We have completed the first of a basic series of studies
on changes of flavor and irritationiwith changes in concentra-
tion of three flavors and of smoke. The four materials selected
to show a wide range of difference in flavor and in irritation,
were furan, aorolein, anethole and whole Philip Morris cigarette
smoke. Sensory evaluation results show strikingly different
patterns for each of these materials with change of concentra-
tion in air dilutions. Furan's flavor increases faster than
does its irritation with increased concentration. By contrast
the reverse is true for acrolein. Irritation increases faster

Cytokine Expression in the CNS: Correlation with the Expression of Neuronal Nicotinic
Acetylcholine Receptors

Introduction

Senile dementia of the Alzheimer's type (Alzheimer’s disease, AD) is characterized by
gliosis and deposits of Eli—amyloid protein in various regions of the cerebral cortex and
hippocampus. Changes in the expression of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) have
been observed in the early stages of AD and smoking can delay the onset of this disease
suggesting that smoking may alter the expression of nAChR. Are there other factors that may
contribute to the observed changes in nAChR expression associated with AD? One molecule
that may play a regulatory role in the CNS is lL-i . The cytokine lL-1 induces inflammation and
immunity in the peripheral immune system, but in the CNS lL-1 induces astrogliosis,
cholinergic neuron sprouting, and the production of amyloid proteins. Further, brain lL-1 is
elevated in AD. The purpose of this application is to determine whether changes in cytokine

expression occur in conjunction with and perhaps resulting from, changes in nAChR
expression.

Ongoing studies in my laboratory suggest an overlap in the expression of members of the IL-1
family (lL-ia, lL-1l5, and lL-1ra) and members of the nAChr family in the CNS as measured by
in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. I have also observed that the expression of
some members of each family are co-regulated in PC12 cells subsequent to differentiation into
neuronal-like cells by nerve growth factor (NGF) or into chromaffin-like cells by
dexamethasone. These findings are consistent with the notion that there exists a regulatory
interplay between iL-i, NGF, and nAChRs in the CNS.

The experiments to be proposed will investigate the possibility that the expression of a
cytokine in the CNS both enhances the action of trophic factors that alter the expression of
nAChRs and whose expression in turn is modiﬁed by the production of nAChRs.

Background

An extended family of related cDNAs that encode functional neuronal nAChRs has been
identified. The mammalian neuronal nAChR family consists of at least six a—like subunits
(designated (12. 03, a4, 05, a6, and a7) and three B—like subunits (designated [32, [53, and [34).
In situ hybridization has demonstrated that RNA for each of these subunits is expressed in
unique, but overlapping, regions of the rat brain. The significance of this result is further
supported by studies where the pair—wise injection of in vitro synthesized RNA encoding an
alpha and a beta subunit into Xenopus oocytes has shown that the pharmacology and single
channel properties of the resulting receptors varies with changes in subunit composition.
Although the subunit composition of a native mammalian nAChR remains to be determined,
the high affinity 3H-nicotine binding sites have been shown to be composed predominantly of
a4+f52 subunits and the 1zsl-a-bungarotoxin site corresponds with the expression of the 0']
subunit. As will be detailed below, I propose to combine the use of in situ hybridization and

immunohistochemistry to address the question of co-expression and regulation of nAChRs and
IL-1 .

Similar to the nAChRs, the lL-1 family consists of distinct molecules that are related by
similarity in size and structure. 0f the three known lL—1 molecules, two, lL—1aand lL-1l3, bind
to the lL—1 receptor (IL-1 R) to induce a pro-inflammatory response. The third member of this
family, IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-ire) competes with IL-10 and lL-1B for binding of the
receptor but fails to activate the receptor signalling pathway upon binding. Hence lL—1ra is

We generated a mutation in the gene for the nonstructural protein N82 of pervovlrus H-l in which the highly
conserved dlnucleotlde AG at the 3' splice acceptor site 01 N32 intron 1 was mutated to CG. The mutation does not
change the amino acid sequence for N81. The splice acceptor (SA) mutant gene was introduced into the Hit virus
(H-tSA) and an infectious clone of Lulll (pLthSA). The R2 tmnscripts encoding N82 were absent by both Northern
blot and primer extension analysis in the Lth SA or PM SA virus-infected cells and the N82 protein was undetectable
in the inlected cell Iysete by immunoprecipitetion. These N52 null mutant viruses were capable of lytlc growth in cell
lines that were derived from human. hamster. and dog. but they produced lower virus titers than wr1d~type 14-1. The
H-1SA virus nonproductively infected Reta rat ﬁbroblasts and transformed Rat? cell lines: Analysis oi synchronized
infections of rat ﬁbroblasts demonstrated that H»1SA viral duplex replicative form DNA replication was reduced and
that single-stranded progeny DNA was deﬁcient compared to wild-type H-1.1n addition. H-lSA viral protein synthesis
was about 10% of wild-type virus and Vlrlons were not detectable in rat ﬁbroblasts. However. H-lSA mRNAe R1 and R3
accumulated to wild-type levels. N82 was also required for productive infection in newborn rats but not in newborn
hamsters. These results indicate that N82 plays an important role in the regulation of viral protein synthesis in rat cells

INTRODUCTION

Autonomous parvoviruses contain a linear, single-
stranded (SS) DNA genome of about 5 kb. The geno-
mic organization has been found to be identical among
the rodent parvoviruses. The viral genome encodes
two overlapping transcription units; the early promoter.
P4. at the left-hand end or the viral genome produces
the transcripts R1 and R2 which synthesize the non-
structural proteins N81 and N82. respectively. and the
late promoter. P38. generates the R3 transcripts which
are translated into the Viral capsid proteins VP1 and
VP2 (Cotmore and Tattersall. 1987).

N51 protein is coded for by a single exon and is
predicted by the sequence to have a molecular weight
of 76 kDa. However. NSt migrates as several 84- to
823ka3 bands on polyacrylamide gels. The slower mo-
bility oi the 88-kDa form of N81 is due to phosphoryla—

cleus and i1 is essential for viral DNA replication (Borne

N82 is a much smaller protein with only 188 amino
acids in parvovilus H-1 and migrates at 25-28 kDe on
polyacrylemide gels. N82 protein of minute virus of
mice (MVM) has three isolorms (Morgan and Ward.
1986: Jongeneel er al. 1986; Clemens er al., 1990;
Cotmore and Tanersall. 1990) and H-1 should have at
least two. The major one is encoded by three exons
with a large intron and a small intron removed during
the splicrng process. Exon 1 ol N82 shares the same
start codon at nucleotide 264 with the N81 gene. thus
N32 and N81 have an identical 84 amino acids at their
amino terminus; exon 2. located at the carboxyl-ter-
minus of the NS 1 gene. is translated in a different read-
ing frame from NSl; exon 3 encodes only 6 amino
acids. The minor isoform of N52 is produced by using
an alternative splice donor and acceptor site for intron
2. Translation laminates before its splice donor site.
therefore its exon 2 is 6 amino acids longer than the
major form of N82 and there is no translated exon 3.
Thus. the two isofonns 01 N82 differ only by the 6
amino acids at their carboxyl-terminel and (Rhode and
Iversen. 1990; lversen and Rhode. 1990) (Fig. 1).

The function of N82 has not been well deﬁned. Since
N81 is essential to virus replication. it is difficult to sep-
arate the gene 01 N82 from N51 and generate muta-
tions in the N32 gene without affecting the structure ol
NS1. To approach this problem. we have successfully

I. Smoke Flavor Studiesl

Six of the important volatile odor constituents of TPM were
measured for the diluted 8 mg and the all-strip non-filtered cigarettes.
These compounds were added to the diluted 8 mg cigarette to raise
their deliveries to the levels of the all-strip non-filtered cigarettes.

Subjective evaluations are being carried out on these fortified 8 mg
cigarettes.

II. Flavor Transfera

Procedures for the analysis of the hydrocarbons in filler and
smoke have been established for the study of the transfer of these
compounds from filler to smoke. There are losses of the added Clo-C13
hydrocarbons in this procedure. Investigations are underway to determine

where these losses are occurring.

III. Hydrocarbon Markers3

Saturated hydrocarbons (Cls-C17) were added to aftercut solution
and sprayed On fillers of various brands of cigarettes. These hydro-
carbons are applied at 20 ppm and can be easily detected and used to
identify various aftercut solutions applied to filler.

IV. Sugar Replacement4

A study has been started to determine if dextrin can—be sub-
stituted for sucrose in the burley spray. Dextrin has been substituted
for sucrose at 25, 50, 75 and 100% levels. Initially all burley

cigarettes will be made and tested subjectively.

V. Alcohol Removal5

Alcohol was removed from the aftercut formulation with no
solubility problem. When alcohol was compensated with water again

there was no solubility problem. Cigarettes were prepared with the 50
modified aftercut solutions. The cigarettes were subjectively indis- CD
tinquishable from control cigarettes by members of the Flavor Develop-’0

INTRODUCTION

To date the best characterized receptorchannel complex is the
muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR). Several studies
demonstrate that muscle AChRs are subject to various forms of
regulation. Distinct changes in channel properties, receptor distribution
and subunit composition are observed over the course of development.
Also, acute changes in the degree of receptor phosphorylation induce a
functional change in the rate of receptor desensitization (for a review,
see Schuetze and Role 1987). These extensive studies of muscle AChR
regulation provide an important intellectual framework for studies of
other ligand-gated channels in the central and peripheral nervous
system.

Initial studies of neuronal nicotinic ACh receptors suggest that
there may be structural, pharmacological, and functional differences
between muscle and neuronal nicotinic receptors (this volume). We are
interested in two related problems pertinent to nicotinic AChR function:
(1) how neuronal nicotinic receptors of the chick sympathetic ganglion
neurons are regulated during development and following synapse
formation and (2) how AChR function may be subsequently modulated

by another transmitter present in these ganglia, the peptide substance P
(SP).

Summary — Nicotine was found to markedly potentiate haloperidol-induced hypokinesia in rats. Nicotine alone
wu without effect. Subsequently. concurrent administration of 2 mg nicotine gum to 10 Toutette syndrome patients
being treated with haloperidol produced a substantial decrease in tics and improvement of concentration and
attention span. Nicotine gum alone was without effect. While 80% of children showed improvement with nicotine
gum, 70% completely discontinued the gum because of side-effects. primarily involving nausea and bitter taste.

Nicotine may prove useful for treating other neuroleptic responsive disorders. such as schizophrenia and
Huntington's disease.

Introduction

Tourette syndrome is a complex disorder invol-
ving long-ten-n motor and vocal tics which is
commonly treated by administration of haloperi-
do]. However. there is now considerable caution
about the long-term use of this neuroleptic,
particularly in view of the risk of later tardive
dysltinesia. In addition, a number of those recei-
ving this medication frequently complain about
the side effects of akathisia. drowsiness, separa-
tion anxiety syndrome and impairment of concen-
tration during schoolwork [4]. It is therefore
important to investigate any agent which could

potentiate the beneﬁcial effects of halcipen'dol,
and thereby reduce the amount of this neuroleptic
needed while retaining the desired effects.
Ideally, such an agent could also increase concen-
tration and attention. given the high comorbidity
of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder with
Tourette disorder. The present paper describes
research demonstrating the potential of nicotine
as an adjunctive therapy with neutoleptics.
Recently, Moss et nl. (IO, 11] demonstrated that
nicotine produced powerful increases in reser-
pine-induced hypokinesia in rats. We were inte-
rested in whether nicotine could also potentiate
the behavioral effects of the dopamine receptor

Possible causes for a decline in the infant mortality rate
during the late 1960s are proposed and examined
statistically.

 

Introduction

The infant mortality rate) in the United States has
declined since 1960. From 1980 to 1965 the decline was
negligible and was a cause for alarm. Most of the decline has
Occurred since 1965. During the periodt1965 to 1970 the
rate dropped from about 25 to about 20 deaths per 1,000
live births. Data through 1972 indicate that it is continuing
to fall al the same rate.

One possih'l' explanation for the fall in infant
mortalit) re. s is related to the falling birth rate observed
during the late 19505 The declt 1e in tlhe overall infant
mortalitt rate could have been caused bv births proportion-
ateti shifting from high mortaliti risk age and birth order

the reduction in mortality rate to “family planning."
(Note: not family planning services. necessarily, but
individual decisions and behavior). We will show that the
changing age-birth order distribution of births since 1.965
does account for about 27 per cent of the reduction in the
United States infant mortality rate that has occurred.

Another possible explanation concerns the advent of
better maternity and infant care services for high risk
mothers. In 1965 the first Maternity and Infant Care
Projects (MIC). funded by the U.S. Children’s Bureau, were
operating. By 1970 more than 125,000 women per year
(counting new maternity admissions only) were being
served by such projects. The effect would presumably be
the reduction of the risk of infant mortality within high
risk categories to something on the order of risk experi

Four previous major reviews on the composition of cigarette

smoke have been published by Johnstone and Plimmer in 1959 (30),
Stedman in 1968 (67), on the vapor phase of smoke by Elmenhorst
~and Schultz in 1968 (12) and on nitrogenous smoke components by
Neurath in 1969 (46). The 1967 book by wynder and Hoffmann (76)

also reviews the composition of smoke, principally from the

biological point of view.

‘~' > After the appearance or each of these reviews more and more
:{sOPhisticated analytical chemical technology has been developed

ifkand applied to smoke analysis and hence the number of compounds

15 titative aspects of smoking methodology have been quite widely
recognized by the workers in the field and virtually all of the

1 more recent publications adhere rather closely to the accepted

.standard conditions of cigarette preparation and smoking.

Another event of great significance to those who aspire to
make quantitative comparisons was the emergence of the Kentucky
1R1 Reference cigarette in 1969. The 1R1 is widely accepted as

Title of Original Grant: Nicotine and Its Direct Inhibitory Action in the Rat Septal Nuclei

Below are the four specific aims that were outlined to achieve the following overall objective, namely, to
analyze in detail the membrane mechanisms by which nicotine activates a specific nicotinic receptor on septal
neurons to yield inhibition.

A) Since nicotine hyperpolarizes directly dorsolateral septal neurons, we need to determine: the
characteristics of the receptor responsible; the ionic species and channel to which this receptor is
coupled; and whether nicotine may also alter ion channels localized within the postsynaptic membrane
that are not coupled to this nicotinic receptor.

II) We will determine how nicotine modulates synaptic transmission as recorded within our septal slice
preparation, namely: 1) excitatory acid mediated excitatory transmission and 2) GAIIA mediated
inhibitory transmission. These studies will include experiments to distinguish pre- and/0r post-synaptic
actions.

C) We will determine how nicotine interacts with several substances that we or others have demonstrated
have biological activity within the septum. These substances are endogenous transmitters or
modulators, e.g., serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine, somatostatin, etc; or drugs, e.g., barbiturates,
benzodiazepines, alcohol, etc.

1)) Finally, using freshly dissociated septal neurons with patch clamp methodology we will examine the
specific channels opened by nicotine and determine which, if any second-messenger systems may be
associated with CNS nicotinic receptor activation.

nmary of results according to four specific aims stated above:
g 1. Nicotine hyperpolarizes DLSN neurons

a. Receptor type ~ m - skeletal muscle nicotinic receptor

’ somewhat sensitive to mecamylamine, but not sensitive to hexamethonium or d-tubocurarine

- completely blocked by kappa-BGTX (neuronal bungarotoxin)

b. Ionic species and channel coupled to CNS nicotinic receptor responsible for hyperpolarization.

- K+ - channel

- CaH - dependent, but does not require initial depolarization.

- response blocked by intracellular injection of IEGTA, while hyperpolarizations resulting front
application of serotonin, norepinephrine or dopamine persist.

- response persists after pertussis toxin treatment which blocks GAIIAB-induced

hyperpolarization.
2. Nicotine can also depolarize these same neurons.
a. Receptor type - different from hyperpolarization, since mecamylarnine enhances depolarization.
b. Ionic Species - unknown, presently
- depolarization associated with decreased conductance, maybe potassium
1011.
II. Nicotine alters synaptic transmission
1. Nicotine primarily acts to depress late hyperpolarizing response (LIIP) and then fast inhibitory
postsynaptic potential (IPSI’). There appears to be little effect on excitatory synaptic potential,
but additional experimetns using both non-NMI)A and NMI)A antagonists are required.
C. Nicotine interaction with other substances - to be done.
D. Nicotine action on freshly dissociated neurons - to be done.

One goal of cancer research is to exploit the exquisite speciﬁcity of immune recog-
nition to eliminate tumors in vivo. Although their role in immune surveillance of

tumor cells remains unclear, CTL are possible candidates for adoptive immunothempy.
The effectiveness of this therapy depends on CTL recognition of speciﬁc tumor an-
tigen. 1g on B cell lymphomas is an ideal tut-nonspeciﬁc antigen since it has a vari
able region (idiotype) that is tumor speciﬁc (I, 2). We report here that human CTL
speciﬁc for the idiotype on autologous B cell tumors could be selectively expanded
in vitro. The phenotype of these CTL is CD3’,CD4-',CDB' and they express the

reduced sidestream visibility.

gigggg: Doublewrapped models of 17.0 mm circumference cigarettes
were made with perforated and nonperforated outer wrap to
determine the effect of perforation on analytical and subjective
results and sidestream visibility. Analytically there were no
major differences, and the sidestream panel saw no significant
differences. However, several expert smokers found a difference
in RTD between the samples, and it was felt that the nonperforated
outer wrap resulted in‘RID that is unacceptably high. The
nonperforated outer wrap also resulted in a slightly higher
reduction in sidestream‘visibility.

Samples of Trim V outer and inner liner were submitted for
chemical analysis to determine process variation. Citrate levels
on the inner liner were consistent with expected values and
represented acceptable variation. Phosphate levels on the outer
wrap were also consistent; succinate levels on the outer wrap were
found to be lower than levels reported by K—C.

Regular circumference cigarette models containing high and low
levels of MAP were evaluated by the sidestream panel, and the low
level sample was preferred. Several different types of CMC were
also evaluated (NB. CHC, KCMC, CaCMC) and were found to be
subjectively unacceptable.

The low sidestream 2h blend was modified for logistical

purposes. Various models were made in a 24.0 mm circumference
configuration using this modified blend and with the existing low
sidestream blend several of these models had charcoal filters at
varying loading levels. The sidestream panel evaluated‘these
cigarettes and felt that a 30 mg charcoal loading resulted in‘a
better smoke with the 2A blend. A charcoal filter does not appear
to offer the same advantage for the modified 2A blend.

The S-port visibility instrument was installed in a lab in the CI
area, and it has been used in trial runs. There is very good
correlation between manually calculated light extinction data and
results automatically generated by the PC attached to the 8-port
instrument. Computerization of the single port has shown larger
differences in data, compared to previous light extinction values
from bit pad analysis. Several modifications to the PC collection
methodology have been made by CAD.

Acquisition of Source Signatures and Receptor Modeling
of Fine Particles and VOC Impacting Indoor Air Quality in
Santiago de Chile and Sao Paulo, Brazil

Antonio H. Miguel
University of California
Riverside, CA

Brief Description

The investigator proposes to test the hypotheses that, (a) the net transport of ﬁne particles and
volatile organic compounds (VOC’s) indoors from outdoor air accounts for a signiﬁcant fraction
of the indoor aersol in Santiago de Chile and Sao Paulo and, (b) that city-speciﬁc proﬁles of
major outdoor and indoor sources plus simultaneous measurements of chemical markers
outdoors and indoors can be used to apportion the major sources ofVOCTs and PM 2.5. Work
involves identifying and measuring city—speciﬁc source tracers in PM 2.5 and VOC’s, measuring
the tracers in outdoor and indoor air simultaneously and applying] developing a chemical mass
balance receptor-based air quality model to apportion outdoor air and indoor air source
contributions to indoor air quality. Ambient air measurements indoors and outdoors will be
made once in the morning and once in the aﬁernoon at four restaurant locations and four ofﬁce
locations divided equally as being near heavy trafﬁc and near a “park-like" setting in each city
(metropolitan area). Two additional outdoor measurements will be made on the sidewalk near
and away fonn trafﬁc to provide supplementary exposure data. The inclusion of four residences
in each city is proposed as an option. Up to ﬁfty constituents/tracers will be measured to include
metals, acids, Total VOC’s, individual VOC’s, and selected source-speciﬁc tracers. A
highlighted component of this work is the construction and deployment of an “advanced”
(source«term/residence-time) sampling system to acquire the samples.

The CIAR is requested to fund the indoor air component of ﬁns work. Outdoor air work will be
performed by collaborating institutions in Chile and Brazil using their own resources except for
the sampling system. Two systems will be constructed using CIAR support and one will be
provided to the collaborators along with training in its use.

Strengths and Weaknesses , A,

The opportunity to acquire source‘apportionment data and estimates of exposure in South
American countries is important for comparison with the extensive US. and European database.
The essentially no—cost participation of local collaborators expert in outdoor air quality is a
strength of the proposal. The principal investigators (and his host institutions) expertise in fuels
and energy-related source contributions is a ﬁirther strength. The principal weakness is an
inadequate description/justiﬁcation of many aspects of the study. It is not clear, for example,

pressure generation: comparison ofsubjects with COPD and age-

continuously monitored esophageal (Pea) and gastric (Pga)
pressures and used these measurements in a three-component
model to estimate instantaneous diaphragmatic (DIA), inspir-
atory accessory muscle (1AM), and postexpiratory recoil (PER)
pressures at various times during inspiration. We validated our
model both by volume-pressure relationships of the respiratory
system (Vrc-Pga and Vab-Pga, where Vrc and Vab are the rib
cage and abdominal volumes, respectively) as well as electro-
myography of the respiratory muscles. Measurements were
carried out at rest and during graded treadmill exercise in 11
subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPDs)
and S age-matched normal subjects (AMNs). AMNs were 59 i
2 (SE) yr and had a forced expiratory volume at 1 s (FEVLO) of
3.6 t 0.2 liters; COPDs were 66 i 2 yr and had a FEVm of 1.0
i 0.1 liters. We noted the following. At rest, both AMNs and
COPDs exhibited an increasing DIA pressure (Pm/I) across
inspiratory time (T1) at rest. As expired minute ventilation
increased with exercise intensity, AM his continued to maintain
this Pun ramp across inspiration; in contrast, COPDs exhibited
higher values of PD”, during the ﬁrst half of TI than during the
second half. At all intensities of exercise, COPDs exhibited
higher 1AM and PER pressures than the AMNs.

diaphragmatic mechanics; ventilatory muscle fatigue; treadmill
exercise

FOR OVER A CENTURY, previous workers have attempted
to evaluate the contribution of different respiratory mus-

cle groups to ventilation at rest and during exercise (4).
In 1976, Grimby, Goldman, and Mead (9) studied thor-
acoabdominal volume-pressure changes in normal hu-
mans and concluded that at rest the diaphragm was the
only importantly active inspiratory muscle. During in-
creasing intensities of bicycle exercise, they observed
thoracoabdominal volume—pressure changes, which they
interpreted as reﬂecting increased activity of the inspir-
atory accessory muscles (IAM) and expiratory muscles.
Grimby, Goldman, and Mead (9) hypothesized that ex~
piratory increases in abdominal pressure represented the
storage of elastic and gravitational energy in the chest
wall at end expiration; at the beginning of the next
inspiration, relaxation of the expiratory muscles would
release this energy and thereby facilitate inspiratory

888

airﬂow.

More recently, Dodd, Brancatisano, and Engel (6)
utilized thoracoabdominal volume-pressure measure-
ments to evaluate the contributions of various ventila-
tory muscle groups to inspiration in patients with chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) during bicycle
exercise. They hypothesized that postexpiratory recoil
(PER) of the abdominal wall resulted in rapid diaphragA
matic descent, outward movement of the rib cage, and
decompression of thoracic gas, and pointed out that
contraction of the abdominal muscles during expiration
tended to preserve diaphragmatic length for the initia-
tion of the subsequent inspiration. However, neither
Grimby et al. (9) nor Dodd et al. (6) attempted to describe
the instantaneous pressures generated by the different
ventilatory muscle groups throughout inspiration.

Macklem and co-workers (2, 3, 13, 14) ﬁrst introduced
esophageal pressure-gastric pressure (Pes-Pga) relation—
ships to infer the contributions of the diaphragm (DIA),
IAM, and PER to inspiratory muscle pressure generation
by a direct graphic method, and showed that this analytic
approach was useful in a qualitative assessment of ven-
tilatory muscle coordination during breathing under dif-
ferent circumstances. Despite the extensive studies of
Macklem and co—workers (2, 3, 13, 14), these authors did
not attempt to quantitate the instantaneous pressures
generated by different ventilatory groups throughout in—
spiration.

In the present study, we use a three—component model
of inspiratory pressure generation to estimate instanta-
neous DIA, 1AM, and PER pressures at various times
during inspiration. We present these estimates for 11
COPD subjects (COPDs) and 8 age-matched normal
subjects (AMNs) during rest and various intensities of
treadmill exercise. We include ventilatory muscle elec-
tromyograms (EMGs) as well as the relationships be-
tween changes in thoracoabdominal displacements and
respiratory pressures (9) to validate the conclusions
drawn from our model of inspiratory pressure generation.

ABSTRACT Retroviral transduction of cellular nucleic
acid sequences requires illegitimate RNA or DNA recombina-
tion. To test a model that postulates transduction via efﬁcient
illegitimate recombination during reverse transcription of viral
and cellular RNAs. we have measured the ability of Harvey
sarcoma viruses (llaSVsl tiith artiﬁcial 3' termini to recover a
rctrovirel 3’ terminus front helper hloloney virus (MoVJ by
illegitimate and homologous recombination. For this purpose.
mouse NIH 3T1 cells were transformed with Harvey proi'iruscs
and then superintected with Mo\’. The proviruses lacked the 3'
long terminal repeat and an untranscrihcd region of the 5' long
terminal repeat to prevent virus regeneration from Input
provirus. Only 0—“ focus-forming units oi llnSV were gen-
erated upon MoV superintection of 3 X 10” cells transformed
by llarvey proviruses with MoV-unrclated termini. This low
frequency is consistent with illegitimate DNA recombination
via random Moloney provirus intcgration 3' of the transform—
ing viral ms gene in the lﬂ‘-kllobase mouse genome. When
portiotts of murinc viral emclopc (em) genes were attached 3'
of ms. 103-105 toens-l‘orming units of llaSV were generated,
depending on the extent of homology with em of MoV. These
reeonthinants all contained llaSV-Specil'tc sequences 5' and
Mo\'-speril’tc sequences 3‘ olthe common (nv homology . They
were probably generated by recombination during reverse
transcription ralher than by recombination among cilht‘r ittplll
or secondary proviruscs, since (i) the yield of recombinant; was
reduced by a factor of 10 when the env sequence was ﬂanked
by splice signals and (ii) llaSV RNAs without retrot‘lral 3'
termini would be inadequate templates for protirus synthesis.
We conclude that there is no efficient illegitimate reconthin. -
tion in retroviruses In view of known precedents ofillegilintate
DNA recombination, the structure of known viral one genes,
and our evidence for illegitimate DNA recombination via
provirus lntegratlon. we favor the DNA model of transduction
over the RNA model.

 

Retroviral transduction of oncogenic sequences requires
either RNA— or DNA<mediatcd illegitimate recombination.
Based on an experimental system that appeared to involve
“surprisingly efﬁcient" illegitimate recombination by RNA
template switching during reverse transcription (1). the RNA
model is currently favored (1—11). This model holds ll'lill n
retrovirus would integrate upstream of a protomne gene,
spontaneously lose its 3' terminus. or fail to terminate during
transcription (9). and produce a 5' viral-3’ proto-mu' mRNA.
In a second step. the cellular 3' region of this hybrid RNA
would recombine with the nonhontologous 3' region of on
intact (helper) retrovirusduring reverse transcription in order
to obtain a retroviral 3' terminus. A competing DNA model
holds that all steps of rctroviral transduction are mediated by
illegitimate primary DNA recombination (12).

The csperintcntul syxtcm tut which the RNA model is

A reinvestigation of the above system demonstrated that
the efﬁcient rcgcncrntton of llztSV in this system depended
entirely on an untranscrthcd U3 regtnn from the 5’ LTR ofthc
truncated provmts (12). Since the~ RNAS trunscribcd from
Harvey prm-irus with on intact 5' LTR. which did regenerate
transforming Virus. and from provirus with a truncated 5’
LTR. which did not rcgcucrutc transforming virus. were
identical, we concluded that HuSV regeneration did not
involve illegitimate recombination with MoV during or after
rcvcrsc trunscription. lnsteztd \\c proposed thttl llaSV was

In an effort to distinguish between the two models of
transduction. we have determined conditions under which a
Harvey provirus with an artiﬁcial 1‘ terminus can recover a

We could confirm the consumption of 31 g phosphoric acid (35 %)

The p53 tumour suppressor gene is an important
participant in the cellular response to ionizing radiation
and other DNA damaging agents. Cells which lack p53
are unable to arrest cell cycle or enter into apoptotic
cell death following irradiation. Moreover, these p53
deficient cells exhibit an increased resistance to DNA
damaging agents, including radiation. The significance
of this radiation-resistance and its relationship to the
role that p53 plays in tumour suppression and the
cellular radiation response has not yet been determined.

In this report we have analyzed p53 deficient mice, ~

expressing either a mutant p53 transgene or having a

- targeted p53 null allele, in order to investigate the role

that p53 plays in governing susceptibility to radiation-
carcinogenesis and in controlling the in vivo
accumulation of chromosomal abnormalities. We Show
that wild-type p53 plays a critical role in controlling
susceptibility to y-radiation—induced tumorigenesis, and
sarcomas and lymphomas rapidly appear in irradiated
p53 transgenic mice. Moreover, this susceptibility to
radiation-carcinogenesis is associated with a two-fold
increase in the in viva accumulation of radiation-
induced double stranded chromosomal breaks relative
to that observed gin wild-type animals. Taken together,
these observations suggest that p53 acts to suppress
tumour formation in vivo by preventing the
accumulation of cells that have sustained radiation-
induced DNA damage. ’

 

Introduction

The genetic damage caused by both ionizing and non-
ionizing radiation plays an important role in neoplastic
development. The eukaryotic cellular response to radiation
is mold—faceted and involves, in part, a cell cycle arrest at
the GlJS or GZI‘M boundary (Kucrbitx er al, 1993} and an
apoptotic pathway of programmed cell death (Cohen e! (22.,
1992). The delay in cell cycle progression presumably
allows time for the repair of damaged DNA prior to
replication or division,'while apoptosis may be a
mechanism to eliminate genetically damaged cells. Recent
evidence has suggested that p53 , which plays an important
role in suppressing tumour formation in a wide variety of
tissues {Levine et al., 1991; Lane & Benchimol, l990), is
additionally centrally involved in of the cellular response to
radiation (Lee et (11., 1994), and in controlling the
radiation-induced GUS cell cycle arrest (Koerhitx at of,
1993) and apoptosis (Lowe e: 03., l993; Clarke e: a!.,

. 1993).

Exposure to ionizing (Kastan 2: al., 1991; Lu and Lane,

1993) or non-ionizing {Lu and Lane, l993) radiation .

causes an increase in the intracellular levels of p53, most
likely due to post-transcriptional stabilization of the p53
protein (Kastan 2: 3L, 1991). The p53protein is a
transcription factor (Fields and long, 1990; Raycroft et (11.,
1990; O’Rourke e! (11., 1990, Santhanam at £23., l99l;
Ginsberg et al., l991; Farmer er £21., 1992), and the
radiation—induced increase in p53 levels leads to a
transcriptional upregulation of the p.21cm gene (Dulic et
al., l994). lecm was initially identified as a gene
regulated by p53 (El-Deity 21 £11., l993) and as a protein
which interacts with the cyclin dependent kinase (Cdk)
Cdk2 (Harper e: 31., 1993). The cyclical activation and
inactivation of Cdks regulates cell cycle progression
(Chutsubo & Roberts, 1993), and p21cm is a potent
inhibitor of Cdk l, 2 and 4 function (Harper e: (21., 1993).
Cdk 2 becomes activated late in Gi and a complex bitumen
active Cde and cyclin E is required for commiunent into
S phase (Ohtsubo & Roberts, l993). p53 dependent up-
regulation of leC‘PI causes a' direct inhibition of cdk 2
activity, resulting in cell cycle arrest at the GUS border.
Cells which lack p53 function continue cycling through
Gl/S after irradiation and halt cell cycle only at G2I'M,
suggesting that both p53 and 1321““ play necessary roles
in a radiation-induced GUS cell cycle checkpoint

_ (Kuerbitx et aL, 1992).

In addition to cell cycle arrest, apoptosis is a frequent
consequence of the exposure of mammalian cells to 'y-
radiation {Cohen of £21., 1992). p53 can induce apoptosis in
a variety of diverse cell types, and also plays a necessary
role in a pathway of radiation-induced apoptosis in
immature mouse thymocytes (Lowe e: at, 1993; Clarke at
£21., 1993). One of the consequences of the losslof this p53
dependent, radiation-induced pathway of apoptosis is that
cells from p53 deficient animals become highly resistant to
the killing effects of y-radiation (Lee and Bernstein, 1993;
Lotem and Sachs, 1993). This radio-resistant phenotype
associated with loss of p53 function may be one
mechanism by which tumours with p53 mutations acquire
resistance to radio-therapy and other chemo-therapeutic
agents (Lowe e: (11., l993b). 7 1

The importance of p53 in both tumour suppression and

., the radiation—response suggests that the two may be

intimately related. The carcinogenic properties of radiation
presumably stem from its ability to cause DNA damage.
Thus, p53 may suppress tumour formation, in part, by
preventing the accumulation of DNA damage. Consistent

with this idea, cultured fibroblasts lacking p53 have _

elevated levels of polyploidy (Harvey et aI., l993) and
gene amplification in vitro (Livingstone e: 51., l992; Yin
er al., 1992}. However, the effect that p53 loss has on in

unscientious oasis

MONTHLY SUMMARY

FOR: David Douglas
1. Non-burning smoking article:

Additional work on this subject was done this month by examining the
filtration effect of a cellulose acetate filter versus no filter. The
sample examined was an IFF tobacco neutral fraction flavor. Fifty
microliters of the sample were applied to a piece of filter paper inside a
plastic tube like those used by Flavor Development for the non-burning
smoking article. Thirty-five ml puffs were withdrawn alternately at one end
containing a CA filter and at the other end, which was open. The results of
chromatograms produced by samples taken in these ways showed that the later,
more polar, less volatile components are reduced disproportionately when
puffed through the CA filter compared to a sample taken with no filter.

This observation could have implications for the use of tobacco-identical
flavors in both burning and non-burning smoking products, since this flavor
is apparently natural and therefore representative of tobacco-identical
flavors.

No additional work is anticipated in this area unless it is desired
by supervisors of the Chemical Research Division, as an aid to Divisional
goals or major R&D programs. However, a memo summarizing the observations
made to date is being written.

2. Setup of an electron capture detector:

Some additional work with the ECD (discussed last month) was done,
mostly to document the work on the PE data system. However in the course of
this work the lower limits of detectability of Lindane and Aldrin were
explored and more difinitively determined. It was found that approximately

300-400 femtograms (10-13 grams) of either pesticide could be detected at a
2:1 signal to noise ratio, but about half this amount could not. A minimum

of 15 picograms of each of the pesticides were detected in 3 microliters of
a bright tobacco extract. The accuracy of the concentration of the
pesticide standard being used was compared with a completely separate
standard of Lindane, and the amounts from each source were found to be
equal within normal experimental variability.

A memo concerning this work is being written, and no further work
will be done in this area unless a need arises.

Cancer bearing is often accompanied by debilitating cachexia manifested as body weight loss and
demngements of host metabolism. We studied |ipoly1ic (fat-mobilizing) activity and glycerol accumulation
in culture media exposed to six diﬁerent human cell lines. An in vitro adipocyte bioassay measured
lipolysis. Media from three of four human melanoma cell lines demonstrated signiﬁcantly elevated
lipolytic activities (279—817% of ﬁbroblast-exposed, control medium). as well as signiﬁcantly more glycerol
accumulation (276»l643'7n of ﬁbroblast medium) which directly correlated with the increased lipolytic
activity. Increased lipolytic activity and glycerol accumulation were not generalized phenomena seen
with all growing tumor cells. as two cell lines (a human colon carcinoma and the fourth human melanoma
line)demonstrated neither signiﬁcantly increased lipolytic activity nor increased glycerol accumulation
compared to ﬁbroblast control medium. This study suggests that certain tumor cells are capable of
transferring a lipolysisvpromuting activity to the media which bathe them. This activity is demonstrable
both as increased lipolytic activity in a bioassay of lipolysis. and as an accumulation ofglycerol (an end
product of triglyceride hpolysis), in the medium exposed to the growing cells. The tumor factor(s) re-
sponsible for this lipolysis—promoting activity may account for the fat wasting that often accompanies

malignancy. (9 I986 Academic Press inc.

lNTRODUCTlON

One ofthe most devastating complications
of cancer is the uncontrollable weight loss and
energy wasting (“the cachexia of_malignancy“)
which plagues the tumor host [1, 2]. Numer-
ous mechanisms [2, 3] have been proposed,
including anorexia and malabsorption (both
tumor—related and iatrogenic), and derange-
ments of host metabolism. Modern methods
of hyperalimentation have not succeeded in
reversing cancer cachexia despite the achieve»
ment of high parenteral caloric intake [4],
leaving one to conclude that altered host me-
tabolism is important in the pathogenesis of
this malnourished state.

Lipid metabolism in the experimental tu-
mor-bearing host undergoes several changes
which are reversible by tumor removal [5—7]
and which are quite different than those at:-

disappearance of retroperitoneal fat stores,
coupled with the concomitant development
of hyperlipidemia, and the reversal of these
abnormalities after tumor excision [5, 6].
prompted us to search for a tumor-associated
lipolysis-promoting “factor" in our animal
models.

Using an in vilm bioassay 0f lipolysis (de-
scribed in this paper). elevated lipolysis-pro-

normalization of serum lipolytic activity and
glycerol concentration, and restoration of lost
body weight [7].

THE K“ CHANNEL OF SARCOPLASMIC RETICULUM

A New Look at Cs+ Block

SAMUEL CUKIERMAN, GARY YELLEN, AND CHRISTOPHER MILLbR
Graduate Department of Biochemistry, Brandeis University, Waitham, Massachusetts

ABSTRACT K*—selective ion channels from mammalian sarcoplnsmic reticulum were inserted into planar phospholipid
bilayers, and single-channel currents measured in solutions containing Cs‘. Current through this channel can be
observed in symmetrical solutions containing only Cs" salts. At zero voltage, the Cs+ conductance is approximately
lS-fold lower than the corresponding K+ conductance. The open channel reetiﬁes strongly in symmetrical Cs* solutions,
and the Cs* currents are independent of Cs* concentration in the range 18~600 mM. Biionic (Cf/K‘) reversal
potentials are only 10 mV, showing that Cs" is nearly as permeant as R ’ , though much less conductive. Addition osz+
to symmetrical K’ solutions reduces current through the channel in L1 voltage—dependent way. The results can be
explained by a free energy proﬁle in which the channel’s selectivity filter acts in two ways: to provide binding sites {or
the conducting ions and to serve as a major rate—determining structure. According to this picture, the main difference
between high-conductance K+ and low-conductance (35* is that Cs‘ binds to an asymmetrically positioned site ~20-fold

more tightly than does K‘.

INTRODUCTION

Virtually all K*-selective ion channels interact strongly
with Cs”. Indeed, there is no known case in which 21 KT‘
channelithat is, an ion channel with a substantial select-
ivity for K+ over Na *71'5 not profoundly affected by Cs“
in the millimolar range. in all cases studied, Cs+ reduces
K+ current through the open channel, i.e,, it blocks the
channel. The common mechanistic picture of this interac-
tion is analogous to competitive inhibition in enzyme
kinetics: the Cs" ion can enter the normal K” conduction
pathway, but cannot permeate it. Whenever a Csl ion is
thus stuck in the open channel, K+ ions are literally
blocked from permeating. K‘“ ions must wait for the C5*
ion to leave the channel via the same route that it had
entered before they can traverse the pore. Though many
variations in detail have been offered in the literature of
Cs‘ block of K+ channels, such studies are usually inter-
preted in terms of these basic elements: the strong binding
and nonpermeation of the Cs" ion.

This picture is reasonable. A K"-selective site of low
ﬁeld strength may easily be expected to bind Cs“L more
strongly than K" (Eisenman, 1961). Since Cs+ is slightly
larger than K+ (0.31 vs, 0.27 rim diameter, respectively), it
is plausible to propose that simple steric hindrance
accounts for the failure of Cs+ to permeate the selectivity
ﬁlter of a K‘” channel.

This study is concerned with (35* block of a K+—seleetive

channel from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), a channel
whose ion conduction properties have been extensively
studied (Coronado and Miller, 1979; Coronado et al.,
1980; Miller et al. 1984). Cs‘ has been shown to reduce
K * currents through this channel in a particularly simple
manner. Cs‘ appears to bind competitively with K“ at a
single site within the channel; the alhnity of Cs+ for this
site varies with applied voltage as though the site is located
35% of the w y down the voltage drop across the channel.
Since Cs+ i: Iectivc as a blocker from only one side of the
channel (the .. .‘j side), and since previous studies failed to
detect conduction by Cs‘, we concluded that this blocker
ion is in fact itnpermeant, and therein lies its ability to
inhibit K‘ conduction (Coronado and Miller, 1979).

The fact that Cs‘ blocks the SR K” channel is surpris-
ing, since it is known (Coronado and Miller, 1982) that
organic cations as large as 0.5 nm in diameter can perme-
ate; the smaller Cs‘ ion, then, cannot be excluded from
permeating for purely stcrie reasons. We now show that
our previous ping—in-the—bottle picture of C5* block is
incorrect, that the Cs” permeability is nearly as high as
that of K'. We also show that a simple picture of Cs+
conduction through the channel can quantitatively explain
all our results on voltage-dependent inhibition of K’
currents by Cs' as well as on open—channel currents under
symmetrical Cs’ and biionic Cs*/K*conditions.

 

MATERIALS AND METHODS

In all experiments here, currents through single channels were recorded

by inserting put SR membrane vesicles into planar lipid bilayers
composed of 907: phosphatidylethanolamine/10% phosphatidylcholine.

Title: Nicotinic Receptors: Role in Secretion of Catccholamines from Chromaffin
Cells

Grant #: 4373

Reviewer: Pierce

Critique

This proposal appears to be a fine tuning of what is already known about the opening
of nicotinic aeetylcholine receptor channels resulting in non specific cation flow and
depolarization of cells. Calcium inﬂux is obligatory for the exocytotic fusion of
catecholaminevcontaining granules with the plasma membrane. The PI has found that
opening nicotinic catecholamine reactors by puff application of nicotine triggers exocytosis
which is regulated by calcium contributed from intracellular stores. There are 3 such pools:
an 1P3 sensitive store, a caffeine sensitive store and an IP3-and caffeine-sensitive store. She
noticed that the exocytotic response to standard depolarizing voltage pulses that open calcium
channels was potentiated after the cell had been exposed to nicotine This potentiation did
not require extracellular calcium, persists for 10 minutes and again, she believes that the
mechanism may include activation of specific intracellular stores. Similar potentiation of
depolarization-induced secretion was observed when cells were exposed to thapsigargin which
elevates calcium in bovine chromaffin cells. The PI is proficient in patch clamping and with
her associate, Dr. Formina, has studied the effect of nicotine on depolarized evoked secretion
and she postulates that the mechanism may involve speciﬁc intracellular calcium stores. She
will use a perforated patch mode to study secretion in the absence of cell dialysis which
allows enough time for the slow run down observed in whole cells, which will enable her to
study the potentiation effects. The strategy is to deplete or block the various intracellular
calcium stores, and then study the reactions in the presence of nicotine. She will also
determine which second messenger systems participate in nicotine triggered secretion.

The experiment seems logical and are in the hands of a person capable of carrying
them out. I am ambivalent about these experiments and would recommend a priority of
about 1.8 but could be moved in either direction by Dr. Sabatini.

Recommendation

Approval with priority of 1.8.

Expression, cytoskeletal utilization and dimer formation
of tropomyosin derived from retroviral-mediated cDNA transfer
Metabolism of tropomyosin from transduced cDNA

. Expression of the tropomyosin-1 isofonn was enhanced by cDNA transfer in non-transformed
murine 3T3 ﬁbroblasts and also in v—Ki~ras transformed ﬁbroblasts in which native tropomyosin-1

expression had been reduced and tropomyosin-

2 synthesis virtually eliminated by action of the

oncogene. The level of synthesis of insert-derived tropomyosin-1 was similar in normal and trans-
formed transductants (3 -5 times normal levels). The high level of insert—derived tropomyosin-1
expression resulted in a considerable increase in tropomyosin-1 utilization in the cytoskeleton of
transformed cells, but this expression still did not reach normal levels, suggesting an oncogene-
related inhibition of tropomyosin utilization. A large proportion of newly synthesized native tropo—
myosin-1 in normal. unmodiﬁed ﬁbroblasts appeared in homodimers which, upon prolonged incuba-
tion, were largely converted to the heterodimers. Excess tropomyosiml derived from the inserted
cDNA also appeared largely as the homodimer in both normal and transformed cells. This homodi-
mer was utilized effectively in the formation of cytoskeletal structures but was partially converted

to heterodimer by chain exchange. Under steady
toskeletal tropomyosin—1-containing dimers were

—state conditions, approximately 33% of the cy-
homodimers, compared to approximately 10% in

normal ﬁbroblasts. The results show that the increased amount of tropomyosin-1 homodimer enter-
ing the cytoskeleton under conditions of tropomyosin-1 excess, results in an atypical microﬁlament
composition. The effect of this excess of tropomyosin-1 homodimers on stability or function of
microﬁlament ﬁbers remains to be determined. The results also conﬁrm that the mechanisms of

rapid homodimer formation with conversion to
vitro studies, also occur in vivo.

The synthesis of several microﬁlament—associated pro-
teins, including tropomyosin (Cooper et al., 1985), vinculin
(Raz and Geiger, 1982, Fernandez et al., 1992), a—actinin
(Gluck et al., 1993), and gelsolin (Vandekerckhove et al.,
1990) have been reported to be suppressed in neoplastically
transformed ﬁbroblasts. Among these, tropomyosin has been
extensively studied.

Tropomyosins are a family of ubiquitous actin-binding
proteins with extensive (rt—helical structure that play a well«
deﬁned role in muscle contraction (Leavis and Gergely,
1984; Payne and Rudnick, 1985', Lees—Miller and Helfman,
1991). In non-muscle cells, the role of tropomyosins is less
clearly understood, and it is generally thought that they are
involved in stabilization of actin microﬁlaments which, in
turn, play an important role in maintaining cell shape, motil-

(Pollard et al., 1976; Cété, 1983; Stossel et a1., 1985). The
terminology of tropomyosins used in this study is one in
general use for tropomyosins expressed in ﬁbroblasts (Lea-
vitt et 31., 1986). Tropomyosins—1—3 correspond, in increas-
ing order of electrophoretic mobility, to the high-Mr tropo-
myosins (284 amino acids), which are homologous to tropo-
myosins expressed in muscle cells, while tropomyosin—4 and
tropomyosin-5 correspond to the low-M, tropomyosins (247
or 248 amino acids) characteristic of non-muscle cells. The
reader is also referred to footnote 2 of Lehrer and Qian
(1990) regarding the terminology of smooth muscle tropo-
myosins. A number of studies have shown that down-regula~
tion of expression of the high-Mr tropomyosin isoforrns con-
sistently accompanies neoplastic transformation of murine
and avian ﬁbroblasts by a variety of retroviral oncogenes,
chemical mutagens and transforming growth factors (l-Ien-

DNA Inoculation Induces Protective in Vivo Immune
Responses against Cellular Challenge with HIV-1
Antigen-Expressing Cells

BIN WANG.“ MICHAEL MERVA.Z KESEN DANG,2 KENNETH El UGENJ-1 JEAN BOYER.l

ABSTRACT

Direct genetic immunization induces immune responses through the delivery of nonreplicating transcription
units that drive the synthesis of speciﬁc foreign proteins within the inoculated host. These proteins are
processed within host cells and through association with relevant MHC antigens that can become the subject of
immune surveillance and elicit immune responses against the pathogen. Direct introduction of genes into mice
has been reported to be antigenic as demonstrated by the use of this technique to develop immune responses
against human growth hormone, inﬂuenza proteins, as well as HIV—1 proteins. Most recently the demonstra-
tion of the use of this technology to produce anti-HIV-l immune responsa has been reported in nonhuman pri-
mates. Accordingly a more detailed analysis of this technology could generate important insight into the gen-

erality of this approach for immune therapy or vaccine design.

In this article we further our investigation of direct DNA inoculation as a tool for induction of relevant im-
mune responses against HIV -1 in viva. We demonstrate expression of HIV «1 antigens in the muscle of eneti-
cally the animals. Inoculated animals demonstrate signiﬁcant cytotoxic T cell responses against HIV -1 antigen-

 

expressing targets. Furthermore, using a novel challenge system, we demonstrate that the majority of

immunized animals can reject lethal, HIV-1 antigemexpressing cell challenge in an antigen-speciﬁc manner.
This technology has relevance for the development of immunization strategies against HIV because it provides

for speciﬁc antigen production in viva without the use of infectious agents.

Xenograft Model of Progressive Human

Proliferative Breast Disease

Fred R. Miller, Herbert D. Soule, Larry Tait, Robert J. Pauley,
Sandra R. Wolman, Peter J. Dawson, Gloria H. Heppner*

 

Background: Progression of proliferative breast disease
has been associated with increased risk for development
of invasive carcinoma. Cell lines have been developed to
facilitate the study of this process. Human cell line
MCFIDA originated from spontaneous immortalization of
breast epithelial cells obtained from a patient with
ﬁbrocystic disease, and cell lines MCFIOAueoN and
MCFIOAneoT were created by stable transfection of
these cells with the neomycin-resistance gene and either
the HRAS gene or the mutated T-24 HRAS gene, re-
spectively. Purpose: Our goal was to develop an
experimental model of progressive human proliferative
breast disease. Methods: MCFIDA, MCF10AneoN, and
MCF10AneoT cells were injected subcutaneously into the
dorsal ﬂank of male nude/beige (C57/BALB/c nu/nu bg/
bg) mice (12 mice for each cell type). These mice were
examined periodically for formation and persistence or
growth of palpable nodules. One mouse per group was
killed 1 week after cell injection; thereafter, mice were
observed as long as possible. Cells were recovered from
palpable lesions by enzymatic dissociation of the excised
lesions. Cells re-established in tissue culture from a
week-14 tumor (MCF10AneoT.TGl) were injected into
12 male nude/beige mice. Southern blot hybridization
analysis of the HRAS gene locus and cytogenetic analyses
were performed. Results: Transplanted MCFIOA and
MCFIOAneoN cells formed transient, small palpable
nodules that regressed and disappeared during the 4th
and 5th weeks. In 10 of the 12 mice, T-24 HRAS gene-
transfected MCFIOA cells (MCFIOAneoT) formed small,
flat nodules that persisted for at least 1 year. Three of
these xenografts became carcinomas. One (removed 7
weeks after transplantation) was an undifferentiated
carcinoma composed of polygonal cells with large,
vesicular nuclei and numerous mitoses. The second
(removed after 14 weeks) was an invasive squamous cell
carcinoma. The third (removed after 56 weeks) was a
moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. Initially,
xenografts of MCF10AneoT.TGl cells showed intraductal
proliferative changes; after 23 weeks, the lesions showed

histologic features resembling those seen in atypical
hyperplasia of the human breast, and later lesions
showed characteristics of carcinoma in situ. The MCF10
lineage of cells of three MCF10AneoT.TG1 xenografts
was confirmed by DNA ﬁngerprinting and karyotype anal-
ysis. Conclusions: MCFIOAneoT and MCFlﬂAneoTJ‘Gl
comprise a transplantable xenograft model that produces
a broad spectrum of human proliferative breast disease.
Implications: The reproducible establishment of repre-
sentative stages in early breast cancer progression from
the MCF10 model offers a new opportunity to analyze
critical events of carcinogenesis and progression in breast
cancer. [J Natl Cancer Inst 85:1725—1732, 1993]

 

Many human carcinomas evolve via a sequence from
benign hyperplasia through atypical hyperplasia to carcinoma
in situ and eventually to fully malignant, invasive tumors
with the potential to metastasizc. In the case of colorectal
neoplasia, the well-recognized polyp-to-carcinoma sequence
is associated with a series of speciﬁc genetic alterations (1).
Although the colon cancer model has become a paradigm for
solid tumor development, deﬁnition of critical genetic events
in breast cancer has been hampered by the lengthy natural
history, architectural complexity, and relative inaccessibility
for sampling of breast cancers, particularly at the small,
early stages. In the human female breast, a spectrum of
pathologic change has been termed proliferative breast
disease. The progression of histopathologic features of
proliferative breast disease has been associated with
increased risk for the development of invasive carcinoma
(2). Women with the most severe form of proliferative breast
disease, atypical hyperplasia, have a fourfold to ﬁvefold
increased relative risk of developing breast cancer.

A series of human mammary epithelial cell lines has been
derived at the Michigan Cancer Foundation from a woman
with fibrocystic disease. Mortal MCF10M cells senesce in

This well written proposal from an experienced clinical investigator
proposes to do an exhaustive exploration of the hypothesis that TGF-alpha
produced by NSCLC cells is bound by the EGF-R present in increased
quantity on many such cells to complete an autocrine growth stimulatory
loop.

The methods to be employed are advanced immunological,
cell-biological, and molecular biological methods. The studies employ
cell cultures, nude mouse implantations, molecular genetic techniques and
monoclonal antibody production along with DNA transfections utilizing
sense and antisense sequences.

Ready access to lung cancer operative specimens is available and
specially derived cell-lines and DNA constructs are at hand. Availability
of the mutated K-ras oncogene which exhibits a point mutation in about
half the tested cases of adenocarcinoma of the lung enabled the author and
his associates to clone this K—ras in an antisense orientation in the
APr-l—neo expression vector.

Consequently, it will be possible to determine whether the
growth-stimulatory effect of TGF-alpha on NSCLC cells is dependent on the
presence of an altered K—ras product as well as to determine whether the
TGF-alpha/EGF-R interaction fulfills all the criteria for proving that an
autocrine loop exists in NSCLC.

The author's intellectual and scholarly command of his topic is
manifest in the proposal. His own laboratory background appears to be in
immunology when judged by his listed publications. The only closely
related manuscript is a preprint of which Dr. Roth is the principal
author.

Dr. Fang did his undergraduate work at National Taiwan University in
chemistry and took his master‘s in that field at Carnegie Mellon and a
doctorate in Bio—organic Chemistry at West Virginia. He came to M.D.
Anderson in 1988. His bibliography is very limited.

was vacuum-concentrated to 25—3 mM (5—7 X 105 c.p.m. per pl). Pep-
tide concentration was determined by tyrosine absorption or quantita-
tive amino-acid analysis. Reaction mixtures contained sDRl at 0.3 pM

were blocked using 20% nonfat dry milk in PBS plus 0.02% NaNj. and
used according to the manufacturer's recommendation. There was a
linear correlation between the number of fast-forming complexes and
the concentration of sDRl used for incubation (S.S.N., unpublished

Cigarette smoking often constitutes an addiction or provides a
form of escape from anxiety. about personal problems. But
smoking in pregnancy presents a special case. Firstly, it is a
danger to the child as well as to the mother. Secondly. since
pregnancy is of limited duration a woman who cannot be
persuaded to give up smoking may accept a substitute at least
while the is pregnant. It would be an advance if her craving
~ could be met by a cigarette free from dangers to the baby.
Accordingly, workers have tried to identify the hattnful
components of tobacco smoke.

Carbon monoxide. nicotine, and cyanides are the factors
which seem most likely to have ill eﬁects on the fetus. Studies
of carbon monoxidc"’ have indicated that the increase in
earboxyhaemoglobin may deprive the fetus ofadcquatc oxygen.
Epidemiological evidence suggests that the type ol‘baby liable
to be harmed by the mother‘s stitching is the one already at risk
for some other reason. Necerthele‘ss. analysis of oestriol
excretion levels has suggested that hypoxia is not the main
inﬂuence on retardation of fetal growth}

evidence‘that stopping in the ﬁrst two months of pregnancy

approach seems called for.“ It is mothers in the lower social
classes and with a poor obstetric performance whose babies
are particularly at risk from smoking. and they might well be

PROPOSAL

Several workers have demonstrated the effects of carbon monoxide on
myocardial metabolism and coronary blood flow. However, the direct effect of
carbon monoxide on the contractility of isolated heart muscle has not been
thoroughly investigated. I propose to conduct a pilot study of this phenomena
utilizing a Blink's isolated heart muscle apparatus and a range of carbon
monoxide concentrations which will be determined experimentally. 0n the
basis of information obtained from this investigation, further studies would
be planned utilizing a working heart apparatus.

Right ventricles removed from laboratory rats would be isolated in a
Krebs-Ringers solution, attached to a force transducer and electrically
stimulated. After equilibration with 95% 02 - 5% C02, the preparation would
be challenged by bubbling various concentrations of C0 — 02 - 5% 002 through
the medium and changes in function compared to the control period noted.

Finally, 95% 02 - 5% C02 would again be bubbled through the medium and

recovery of function assessed.

In addition to being recorded on the Grass recorder, the wave form of the
contraction and stimulus pulse will be displayed on and photographed by a Hewlett-
Packard Oscilliscope-camera system. In this manner the onset and decline of
developed tension, the latency period between stimulus and contraction, and the

resting tension during the pre-CO, the CO and recovery from CD periods will be

compared.
The information obtained in this functional analysis would then be used as
the basis for a more detailed study of the biochemical and electrolyte changes

produced in cardiac muscle as a result of CO exposure.

introduction

The c—fos gene belongs to the family of growth- and differentiation-related
immediate early genes whose expression, in vivo and in vitro, represents the first
measurabie response to a variety of chemical and physicai stimuli including
tumor promoters and DNA-damaging agents. The expression of c-fos has been
identified as a signal for cell proliferation, but also for apoptosis.

Key Findings:

2R1 mainstream smoke-bubbled phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) induces
c-fos expression in quiescent 3T3 ﬁbrobiast cells

concentration-dependently. A threshold concentration of approx. 0.015
puffsiml was observed.

by interfering with transcriptionai and posttranscriptional regulatory
components since a slight induction of the c—fos promoter and a strong
stabilization of c-fos transcripts were observed. The translation of smoke-
bubbled PBS-induced c-fos mRNA into protein was conﬁrmed using immuno-

detection methods.

independently of the presence of hydroxyl radicals formed by the Fenton
reaction since neither o-phenanthroline - an efﬁcient, membrane permeable
scavenger of iron cations - nor catalase were able to reduce cigarette smoke-
dependent c—fos expression at concentrations that were shown to inhibit DNA

strand break formation.

the kinetics being different from those reported for physiological inducers
(growth factors, serum), TPA, or stress treatment (heat shock, UV, hydroxyl

radicals).

in a manner very similar to that described for okadaic acid, a specific inhibitor
of cell cycle-speciﬁc phosphatases 1 and 2A (PP-112A). Cellular effects

shared by smoke-bubbled PBS and okadaic acid in vitro are:

. kinetics of c-fos expression,

0 pattern of c-fos expression, i.e., the slight activation of the c-fos
promoter as well as the stabilization of c-fos mRNA,
partial inhibition of protein synthesis,

induction of stress response genes such as heme oxygenase,
induction of cell cycle arrest, and

inhibition of PP-‘i/ZA enzymatic activities.

a:

associated with a concentration-dependent loss of total cellular glutathione
(GSHM).

Regional and Mechanistic Differences in Platelet-derived Growth

Porcine Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells*

Three specific platelet-derived growth factor
(PDGF) isoforms are thought to bind with differing
affinities to two distinct PDGF receptors which
undergo activation following dimerization. Recent evi-
dence has been presented that marked differences exist
between the ability of PDGF-AA versus PDGF-AB and
PDGF-BB to stimulate alterations in second messen-
gers in cultures of vascular smooth muscle cells
(VSMC), a result which was thought to be due to low
numbers of the A-type receptor in this cell type (Sach-
inidis, A., Locker, R., Vetter, W., Tatje, D., and Hoppe,
J. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 10238—10243, 1990). In
particular, PDGF-BB and PDGF-AB but not PDGF-
AA could elicit alterations in cytosolie free calcium
(C4122). However, because these studies were per-
formed on large cell populations using biochemical as-
says of PDGF activity, a minor PDGF-AA-Ca2+-re-
sponsive population of cells might go undetected. To
test this possibility, VSMC were isolated from either
thoracic or abdominal pig aorta, and alterations in
C232",- were monitored using Multiparameter Digitized
Video Microscopy following stimulation with PDGF
isoforms alone, or either before or after exposure of
VSMC to 5 mM EGTA. PDGF-AA-responsive cells were
found to exist only in cultures of thoracic VSMC,
caused oscillations in 082+“ represented 20% of the
PDGF-BB-responsive cells, and were subsequently re-
sponsive to PDGF-BB. PDGF-BB elicited monophasic
alterations in Ca“,- in both thoracic and abdominal
VSMC. Prior addition of EGTA inhibited PDGF-AA
but not PDGF-BB-induced alterations in Caz’ﬁ. Addi-
tion of EGTA during PDGF-AA-induced Ca2+,- oscilla—
tions inhibited subsequent oscillations in Cazm while
addition of EGTA at the peak of the PDGF-BB Ca2+
response resulted in a more rapid return of Ca“.- to
prestimulation levels. These data suggest that regional
differences in the distribution of PDGF-A— and B—type
receptor exists in viva, and that activation of the A-
and B-type PDGF receptors results in distinct altera-
tions in 0322.

PDGF1 elicits a variety of biological activities in VSMC
(mitogenesis, chemotaxis, and vasoconstriction) through the
existence of distinct PDGF isoforms and receptors (1—4).
Human PDGF consists of two disulﬁde-bonded homologous
peptide chains, A and B (PDGF-AB). Each chain is the
product of a distinct cellular gene, their expression being
independently regulated and the two chains sharing approxi-
mately 50% homology (5—7). Porcine PDGF appears to be a
BB homodimer as is PDGF isolated from most animal species
(except human) (8). Skeletal and smooth muscle, growth
factor-stimulated ﬁbroblasts and a number of tumor cell lines
produce exclusively PDGF-AA (9—11).

These different types of PDGF molecules are thought to
bind to at least two distinct types of PDGF receptors. The
originally described receptor (B-type, 180 kDa, similar to the
CSF-l receptor) was found to bind the B chain of PDGF, is
located on chromosome 5 and possesses tyrosine kinase activ-
ity (12). A second type of PDGF receptor (A-type, 170 kDa,
similar to the C-kit gene product) is thought to bind both
PDGF A and B chains, is located on chromosome 4, and also
contains tyrosine kinase activity (13). Since the receptors
display some selectivity in terms of which PDGF chains they
can bind, and because active PDGF molecules are thought to
exist as dimers, a number of models have recently been
proposed where PDGF binding to its receptors requires di-
merization of the A- and thype receptor subunits to elicit
functional activity (14—16). These models predict that dimer-
ization of two A-type receptors could lead to binding of all
three types of PDGF isoforms (AA, BB, AB), While dimeril
zation of two B-type receptors could only lead to binding of
PDGF-BB (although some data suggests that PDGF-AB can
bind to cells containing only the B-type receptor albeit at 10-
fold lower afﬁnity than PDGF~BB). A key aspect of these
models is that in cells lacking the A-type PDGF receptor,
there should be no response to either PDGF~AA or PDGF-
AB.

The mechanisms by which PDGF binding to its receptor is
transduced into biological activity are still unclear. Our lab-
oratory has been studying the role of PDGF-induced altera-
tion in Ca“; in PDGF»stimulated mitogenesis (17—21). PDGF
addition to a variety of cells causes a rapid transient increase
in Ca3+. within seconds of addition (22), and results from our
laboratory as well as others (1741, 23—31) demonstrate that
inhibition of PDGF-stimulated increases in Ca",- also inhibit

_I_. WLTIFACTORIAL ETIOLOGY

Because of the problem of interrelationship, certain of the

suspected factors other than smoking will be mentioned briefly. The
objectives in doing so are:

(a) To emphasize the need for developing a perspective that
will lead to the eventual evaluation of the various
suspected factors as being independent, correlated,
cumulative, antagonistic or synergistic agents in the

origin and/or progressive development of cardiovascular
disease.

(b) To indicate possible variables in connection with which

smokers of various types and degrees may be contrasted
with non-smokers or with those who have discontinued
smoking for different periods of time.

Multifactorial Studies

 

Several multifactorial prospective studies, particularly those of
the Framingham group, of the Albany group, of Stamler and of Oglesby Paul have
endeavored to reach a profile description of the coronary-prone individual.

For such purposes, it has been necessary to employ available clinical
definitions of the various cardiovascular conditions, in order to relate

incidence epidemiologically to constitutional and environmental factors. In

general, the lack of autopsy data has been recognized as a serious handicap
to precise description and classification.

Some degree of success has been attained in reaching a profile
description. Hereditary factors seem to be quite generally recognized.
Epidemiologically, a rather persistent association between prevailing high
serum cholesterol levels and risk of developing cardiovascular disease has
been reported. High prevailing blood pressures, overweight, cigarette smoking,
left ventricular hypertrophy, low vital capacity, history of shortness of
breath, history of peptic ulcer, history of chest discomfort, A-V nicking of
the fundi, and heavy use of coffee have been reported also to show various
degrees of association. Combinations of certain of these factors are
associated with higher risk in some reports, but not in others.

Of course, no studies of this kind can be used alone to determine
whether any one or any combination of the measured factors actually contri-
butes causally to production of disease or whether they tend rather to reflect
the existence of some constellation of more basic congenital predisposing
characteristics which result in higher disease incidence. For example,
voluntary cessation of cigarette smoking may itself reflect selective
constitutional differences. The inevitable uncertainties inherent in these
studies are recognized as being a severe handicap to design of effective
preventive measures.

It is of interest that cigarette smoking does not appear to be
associated with development of chronic angina. Since this disease is
considered to be a consequence of general atherosclerotic narrowing of the
coronary arteries, this lack of association has been interpreted as indicating

SUMMARY

This study was initiated to evaluate the effect of a synthetic
chemical on the general reproductiye performance of albino rats. The
test material was administered orally to male albino rats for 60 days
and to female albino rats for 14 days prior to mating at dosage levels
of O, 15, and 75 mg/kg/day. Approximately one—half of the females were
sacrificed on Day 14 of gestation and Caesarean sections were performed.
The remaining females were allowed to deliver normally, and the litters

. were carried to weaning. Administration of the test compound continued

throughout the study .

All parental animals survived the study, and no outstanding
effects were noted in the males or females..

There were no meaningful differences in the number and
placement of implantation sites, resorption sites, and live fetuses among
the females sacrificed on Day 14 of gestation.

Fertility indices for the animals that rebeived the test

material were not meaningfully different from the controls. Gestation,

Mammalian L-histidirte apodecarbosylase
(EC 4.1 l.22). hereafter referred to as histi-
dine decarbnsylase (HD). is present in most
tissues (ll. Activation of this system in the
microcirculation produces the delayed-
prolonged inﬂammatory response [2) and
Schayer (3-5) has proposed that histamine
synthesized by this system in the microcircu-
latior. constitutes a primary mechanism of
intrinsrc microcirculatory regulation. Basic to
this premise is his proposal that the princi-
pal site of HD is microcirculatory endotheli-
um. a premise which to date has not been
e\perimentally verified.

The present study was undertaken to e\-
amine the activity of HD in both endotheli-
uni and in other components of the vascular
wall in an attempt to test this basic assump-
tion of Schayer's intrinsic microcirculatory
control hypothesis.

Quiegtive; Relate the design of cigarettes to their thermal properties.

Rggglts: The heat loss of Ereely smoldering cigarettes has been measured with
a calorimeter. Additionally, the heat loss of cigarettes smoldering on
fabric/foam substrates has also been measured. Cigarettes smoldering on
substrates lose weight at about 85%t0f their rate during free burn. The
cellulosebased fabric used in these experiments has a heat of smoldering
combustion comparable to the cigarettes themselves. The dimensions of the
cigarette coals were unchanged by placing them on the substrate. contrary to
NIST’s observation. The power output of the freely smoldering cigarettes
appears to be a linear function of the MBR, while the heat ﬂux appears to be
independent of MBR.

Further, experiments show that substrates affect cigarette MBRs at separation
distances of up to 4L5 mm, suggesting that the disruption of the boundary layer
may be an important factor intextinguishments

We have also monitored the out ﬂow of gases from cigarettes smoldering in free
air and on fabric/foam substrates. We see the ﬂow rates cycling about a mean
ﬂow—-this behavior may be related to temperatures cycling in the cigarettes.

Plans: We plan to measure the heat ﬂux of freely smoldering cigarettes and

cigarettes smoldering on fabric/foam substrates as functions of air ﬂow. This
should allow us to determine heat flux as a function of ﬂow rate in order to

explain the role of ﬂow‘ on fabric ignitions.

Lymphocytic Infiltration in Uveal Malignant Melanoma

PANFILO 0. DE LA CRUZ JR, MD, CHARLES S. SPECHT, MD, AND lAN W. MCLEAN, COL, MO, USA

A study relating the intralesional inﬁltration of lymphocytes and plasma cells to patient survival was
performed on cases of uveal malignant melanoma accessed at the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology,
Washington, DC (AFIP) between 1954 and 1971. The authors examined 1193 cases using light microscopy.
Of the 1078 cases with technically acceptable histologic sections. 134 tumors contained 100 or more
lymphocytes per 20 high-power (X400) microscopic ﬁelds (20 HPF). The prevalence was 12.4%. This
was designated the “high lymphocytic” group. An equivalent number of cases with fewer lymphocytes
comprised the “low lymphocytic” group. The survival rate at 15 years was 36.7% for patients in the high
lymphocytic group and 69.6% for patients in the low lymphocytic group. Using the Cox model, the authors
found that an increased number of lymphocytes per 20 HPF was signiﬁcantly associated with decreased
survival (chi-square = 21.2, P = <0.l][|l]1). A signiﬁcant association was observed even when we controlled

for other risk factors (chi—square = 6.98, P = 0.008).

Cancer 65:112-115, 1990.

T HE IMMUNOLOGIC role of lymphocytes and plasma
cells in malignant tumors has been extensively stud-
ied in the last two decades. Speculations have been made
on whether or not the presence of these mononuclear cells
in tumors has an effect on patient survival. Underwood,l
in his review of the literature, found a favorable association
between lymphocytic inﬁltration and patient survival in
most cancerous tumors. In succeeding publicationsf‘4
contradictory results were presented regarding this asso-
ciation in cases of cutaneous malignant melanoma. In
patients with uveal malignant melanoma, Davidorf and
Lang5 found that the survival was better if the tumor con-
tained a lymphocytic inﬁltrate, whereas Vité found the
opposite. Interpretation of these studies is difﬁcult because
lymphocytic inﬁltration was either poorly deﬁned or sub
jectivcly evaluated. Because of these problems we under-
took a study relating intralesional lym phocytic and plas—
macytic inﬁltration in uveal malignant melanoma to pa-
tient survival. Multivariate analysis of lymphocytic

its prognostic value.

Materials and Methods

One thousand one hundred ninety-three uvcal malig-
nant melanoma cases accessed between I954 and 1971
were retrieved from the ﬁles of the Registry of Ophthalmic
Pathology at the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology,
Washington, DC for use in this study. One thousand sev-
enty«eight cases had hematoxylin and eosin—stained his-
tologic sections that were technically acceptable. All tu-
mors containing 100 or more lymphocytes per 20 high-
power (X400) microscopic ﬁelds (HPF) were selected for
the “high lymphocytic" group. We chose the next accessed
case of uveal malignant melanoma with less than 100
lymphocytes per 20 HPF for the “low lymphocytic” group.
Without knowledge of the patients’ follow-up data, the
number of lymphocytes and plasma cells were counted
separately in 20 HPF within the tumor; tumor size in its
largest dimension (LTD) was measured; Callender cell
type, degree of necrosis, mitotic activity, distribution of
lymphocytes, scleral invasion, and orbital invasion were
coded. The risk factors were coded as follows: (1) lym-
phocytic and plasmacytic inﬁltration as the log of the
number of cells plus one per 20 HPF; (2) distribution of
lymphocytes as perivascular or diffuse; (3) Callender cell
type as spindle. mixed, or epithelioid; (4) tumor size as
measurement of largest dimension; (5) necrosis as 0 to 4

subverted. The creator of the unusual illustrations is Lydia
Kibiuk, a well-known medical illustrator based in Baltimore.

The Hostage Bram reveals the most recent advances
in brain research, but unlike other books on the brain, it
describes key discoveries together with the social and political
implications that surround them. It invites the reader to think
of the human brain as the organ that invented politics, philos-
ophy, all the arts, and even the uniquely human traits of
mercy and compassion. It is written to appeal to a broad
audience of adults and young people, including bright high
school students. It tempts everyone to think about their brains
and to wonder, in a more informed way than before, just why
we think and act the way we do

TOBACCO AND FILLER

A.

The following compounds were identified in the B—glucosidase

'hydrolyzate of the E—55 glucosidic fraction by Dr. F. Hsu

using GC/MS: 3-methyl—l-butanol, 2-methyl-2-buten-l-ol,
3-hexen—l—ol, benzaldehyde, benzyl alcohol, phenethylalcohol,
2-methyl-5—(2-methyl-5-isopropenyl tetrahydro-Z—furyl) furan
(tentative identification), 3—oxo-a-ionol, blumenol C,
4-(3—hydroxybutylidene)—3,5,5—trimethyl—2-cyclohexone (two
isomers), cadineol, and hydroxysolavetivone (two isomers).

Propyl paraben determinations have been made on 45 RL samples
and size. Size samples at timed intervals during a Pilot
Plant run showed no concentration variation over several
hours. RL sheet samples analyzed randomly indicated a small
amount of application cycling in concentration levels.
Standard response in the range of 100 to 2200 ng/ul was
linear. Lower limit of detection under current analytical
practices is m20 ng/ul. The RL sheet generated will be made
into cigarettes to determine dust generation from RL as well
as possible transfer of propyl paraben to non—RL blend

components.

We are currently working with Ms. E. T. Oakley in developing
a procedure for estimating oriental tobacco in cigarettes.
The methyl ester of B-methylvaleric acid is used as the
marker for oriental. Contributions from bright and burley
tobaccos appear to be minimal (<10 ug/g versus N950 ug/g for
oriental).

Preliminary results with synthetic Marlboro blends show good
correlations, but B—methylvaleric acid concentration ranges in
various grades of oriental from different countries need to be
determined.

A procedure is being developed for determining C2-C6 volatile
fatty acids in tobacco and filler. Although we were not
successful with butyl ester derivatives because of dilution
problems, benzyl ester derivatization shows promise. This
procedure involves the reaction of the tetrabutylammonium
salts of the acids with benzyl bromide in acetone.

ong primates, including man. Visual

. d, particularly, auditory signals have

en studied in considerable detail in a

umber of species, but our knowledge of

Irimate chemical communication is still

latively poor.

The South American marmosets and

'nmarins are excellent models for the study

nave favored the use of chemical signals.
lspecies in this family possess highly

in scent marking. The subject of our

research, the saddle-back tamarin

undertaken long-term studies of the
c0mmunicatory content and chemical
Composition of these scent marks, along
With their role in some areas of social
behavior.

 

    

Our aim is to determine how
communicatory signals are encoded and
how they are interpreted by recipients. Our
studies have shown that the scent marks
contain a detailed communicatory code
which enables the recipient to obtain
important information on the scent donor.
The monkeys can discriminate between
their own scent and that of several other
callitrichid species and subspecies. Cues
for male-female discrimination, and
discrimination between castrated and
normal males, are also present. Moreover,
the monkeys discriminate between scents
from dominant and submissive males, and
between familiar male as well as female
individuals. The scent may also contain
cues which allow the tamarins to assess the
period of time that elapsed since the scent
mark was deposited. The interpretation of
such information is inﬂuenced by the social
context in which it is perceived, as well as
by the previous experiences of the
recipient. These factors, in turn, influence
the responses to the scent.

The scent marks are chemically
complex. The major volatile compounds
are squalene, cholesterol and a series of
butyrates. In addition, volatile compounds,
as well as a number of high molecular
constituents, among them proteins, are
important in determining the sensory
qualities of these highly complex “social
perfumes.”

Chemistry of Aphrodisin

Alan Singer

My research interest is the chemical
identiﬁcation of mammalian pheromones,
compounds that act via the chemical senses
to help regulate social interactions in a
population of mammals. An important
motivation for this research is the
expectation that identiﬁcation of such
compounds with a demonstrable and
biologically important function will lead
directly to advances in the understanding
of the chemical senses by providing useful
stimulus molecules for the study of
structure-activity relations and for the
investigation of peripheral chemoreceptor
mechanisms.

The approach is interdisciplinary,
collaborative, and it is based on the
classical technique of chemical
fractionation followed by biological assay,
a process that is repeated until pure active
compounds are isolated. These active
compounds are then characterized by
appropriate chemical and biochemical
techniques for the analysis of molecular
structure.

One result of this work has been
the isolation and characterization of
aphrodisin, a protein produced by female
hamsters that acts on vomeronasal
chemoreceptors to elicit sexual behavior
from males. The structure of this protein
shows that it is a member of a superfamily
of extracellular proteins secreted by glands
in numerous animal species, and most
closely related to the recently described
odorant-binding protein. Experiments on
the behavioral and physiological activity
of “synthetic” aphrodisin (produced by
molecular cloning in bacteria) have already
demonstrated that identiﬁcation of
authentic mammalian pheromones will
lead to signiﬁcant advances in research on
the chemical senses.

Abstract. A 24 amino acid polypeptide that does not originate from (pre)proenkephalin has been isolated from mine
adrenal chromafﬁn granules. [15 sequence is: Arg-l.eu-l’ro-Gly-le[cu-Arg-Asnfl'yr-Leu-Asp-Tyr~Gly~Glu-Glu-Val—

Gly~Glu-Glu-Ala-A|a-Arg-Gly-Vttl. This peptide is generate
partially sequenced. The proteolytic cleavage occurs at a tri

banks shows very little homology to any known protein.

In the course of our attempts to elucidate the steps in-
volved in (pre)proenkephalin processing in both bovine
and ovine adrenal medullary cells [for review see ref. 5], we
have isolated a number of opioid and nonopioid peptides
derived from proenkcphalin [6, 12. 13]. We have also ob-
served a number of other peptides whose sequences were
not contained in the prohormone sequence [l, 7]. These
peptides were present in amounts equal to or greater than
the proenkephalin fragments and exhibited no cross-reac-
tivity with antisera against Met- and Lcu-enkephalin. We
present here the puriﬁcation and sequence ofa peptide and
its precursor from ovine adrenal chmmafﬁn granules that
are not derived from proenkephalin and which may be phy-
siologically active peptides secreted by the adrenal me-
dulla.

Materials and Methods

Fresh ovine adrenal glands were obtained from the slaughter-
house and kept on ice until dissection. Upon removal ofthe cortex,
chromalﬁn grannies were prepared from the medulla by differen-
tial centrifugation as described elsewhere [2] and stored at ~80 °(‘.
until further processing. The granules were lysed in l Macetic acid
and 20 mM llCl containing 0.1% 2-mercaptoethunol (1:5 w/v.).
Phenylmethane sull'onyll'luoride in acetone and pepstatin A in eth-
anol (1 pg/ml of each) were added as protease inhibitorsjust prior
to lysis. The ﬁnal supernatant from 40,000 gcentrifugation (I h) or

SACCHARIN

Several tipping papers and one reference tipping paper
sample Were analyzed for saccharin. The qualitative and
quantitative analyses were performed by HPLC. The method
involved acid (0.05N H2504) and diethyi ether extraction
and determination on a C8 column (15 cm) with water, acetic

acid, methanol (59/1/40) eluent.

All results Were confirmed by GCZ/MS‘after derivatization
of saccharin to N-methyl saccharin (2) by M (197) and
fragmentation. Results have been submitted to QC PME

(3) (4).

At the request of QC PME a rather simple spot test for the
presence of sodium saccharin on TP is being sought. The

precipitation reaction‘between a dilute acidic silver nitrate

solution and‘sodium saccharin seems promising. Work is
continuing concerning the sensitivity and the selectivity

of the method.

I SMOKING GUIDELINES, SMOKING POLICIES AND ACCOMMODATION
PROGRAMS UTILIZING ADEQUATE VENTILATION
Smoking guidelines, smoking policies and accommodation can oﬁer methods (i) to
address the interests of smokers and nonsmokers, (ii) to reduce nonsmoker exposure to ETS - the
smut depending upon the type of policy or accommodation that is implemented, all (iii) at little or
no additional cost. ’3

Because most of all US. businesses have smoking policies, federal regulation that
encourages the use of individualized policies should be helpﬁII to business. Snell ﬂexibility will also
allow employees and employers to interact in a meaningful way on these issues to craft the best
possible solution for their Work environment. [For reference, see Materials Volume at Tab No. 2,

and Tab No. 3.]

O SEPARATION OF SMOKERS AND NONSMOKERS, SHARING A COMMON
VENTILATION SYSTEM

Simple spatial separation of smokers and nonsmokers in the workplace has a
profound eﬁ‘ect upon nonsmoker exposure to ETS, Depending upon the conﬁguration of individual
workplaces, exposures of nonsmokers to ETS constituents reportedly have been reduced
dramatically — in some instances, to levels at or below the limits of detection or quantitation for air
monitoring devices. Further, simple spatial separation of smokers and nonsmokers has prov-
effective in minimizing nonsmoker exposure to ETS in a variety of settings under various existing
HVAC conﬁgurations. including those that provide recirculated air, existing exhausts, pressure-
zoning and/or local ﬁltration. In short, simple separation of smokers and nonsmokers

signiﬁcantly reduces nonsmoker exposure to ETS, at little or no additional cost.

The role of cytoplasmic riboscnnes in protein synthesis has been
studied extensively in the past; more recent discoveries suggest
(Noll et s1, 1963) that the Mctionsl units or protein synthesis are
ribosomal aggregates, "ergosomhes", consisting of particles held
together “by n-RNA. The origin of cytoplasmic ribosomes is a matter of
some speculation but a current fsvorite is that riboscnnal mm is
synthesized in the nucleus.

The purpose of our report is to present some data which
indicate that nuclear ribosomes ere labeled earlier than cytoplasmic
micrdsomes during tissue reparation, suggesting nuclear origin of the
cytoplasmic microsomss. The stuéies were carried out on subcemiar

Grant Application No. 1630; Henry Sershen, New York.

Dr. Sershen is a relatively young investigator who did most of his training

and work at New York University.

This is an application similar to the one we had already in the same book which
deals with the mechanism of Parkinson's disease. The previous application
mentioned the fact that smokers seem to have a lesser incidence of Parkinson‘s
disease. No mention is made of this in the present application. However, he
introduces a new approach, namely that of using a new compound which can give
rise to severe Parkinson’s disease in humans. This compound MPTP seems to be
quite effective in this respect and is useful in producing a model in rodents.

His approach is both by chemical and electron microscopy. He is also
interested in determining catecholamine levels in brain tissue, GABA levels
and more interesting, receptor binding properties. So far his results have
not turned up anything, but the potential certainly is there.

The application is a little on the thin side, but in some ways it is refreshing.
I get the impression that this man is young and relatively untried, having
worked primarily with his sponsors at New York University. I would like to

know more about the institute where he is working. ‘
. In any case despite its thinness, I think it would

be an interesting application. It is relatively inexpensive and there are
no other funds available. I would take a flyer,

1. Backggound and Signiﬁcance.
T lymphocytes play a vital role in the defense against viral and bacterial

invaders as well as malignant cells that arise from host tissues. The biochemical
mechanisms they use to interact with their immediate environment enable them to
respond to a variety of different extracellular stimuli to mount an effective immune
response. For example, this can take the form of localizing to a speciﬁc area of
inﬂammation via binding of cell adhesion molecules expressed on the T cells and
infected or inﬂamed tissues. Recognition of speciﬁc antigen by the T cell receptor as
well as ligand binding to other so-called "accessory" receptors can also stimulate
lymphocyte activation leading to cell proliferation. lymphokine secretion and
ampliﬁcation of the immune response. Thus, a more thorough understanding of the
ways in which lymphocytes communicate with their extracellular milieu is of
profound importance to our knowledge of the workings of the cellular immune
system. Moreover, such knowledge can potentially lead to the rational design of
therapeutic interventions which could either amplify or dampen this response.

Over the past several years. my laboratory has focused on studying a T cell
plasma membrane receptor which we discovered as a binding protein for pertussis
toxin (PT). The exotoxin of Bordetella pertussis is a member of a group of bacterial
towns that are structurally composed of two functional subunits. The “A" subunit
has enzymatic activity as a mono-ADP—ribosyltransferase which catalyzes the
covalent modification of substrate proteins by the addition of an ADP-ribosyl moiety
utilizing nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide [NADl as the donor. The substrates for
this reaction are GTP<binding "G" proteins which couple intracellular second
messenger generating systems to membrane receptor signalling. PT is known to
ADP-ribosylate the alpha subunits of a number of G proteins belonging to the G1

class. including G151 and Gpa, as well as transducin in vertebrate photoreceptors.
The “B" subunit of these toxins is thought to facilitate binding to the plasma
membrane via specific receptor sites and to allow entry of the toxin into the
intracellular compartment. In most cells. the effects of PT require a prolonged pre—
incubation period with high doses of the toxin, suggesting that either entry of the
toxin into the cell is slow and may be rate-limiting for the observed biological effects.
or that higher intracellular concentrations of the toxin are required. In cell-free
systems, treatment of the toxin with reducing agents is necessary to produce its
enzymatic activity. presumably by reducing intrachain disulﬁde bonds.

In T lymphocytes PT stimulates cell activation, including the generation of
second messengers such as diacylglycerol. increases in intracellular Ca2+. and
tyrosine protein phosphorylation. resulting in cell proliferation. These effects of the
toxin require only the B subunit, or ’PTB" (1). The toxin receptor requires the co-
expression of the CD3-T cell antigen receptor complex. suggesting that. like other so—
called "accessory" mitogenic signalling receptors on T cells. the PTR stimulates cells
by activating the T cell receptor (1). We have shown that the B subunit binds to a 43
kDa T cell plasma membrane protein, suggesting that this is the receptor that
mediates the mitogenic effects of the toxin (2). It has been unclear whether the toxin
receptor(s) is a novel protein or has been previously identified as something else. One
possible. although unlikely. candidate that we considered was the CD38 antigen. a

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
TITLE: Role of the erbB3 protein in growth factor-coupled signaling

BACKGROUND

It is well accepted that cancer is the outcome of a loss of re ulation at one or more points of a growth
factor-coupled signal transduction pathway. This has generate a great deal of interest in understandin
the sequence of events that leads to a mitogenic response. In this "Background section“, I first wi
present a brief overview of the superfamily of growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases that have been
implicated in human cancers, and in particular, in lung cancers. This Will be followed by a general
description of our proposed studies (based on hypotheses that are put forward from our ongoing research)
and the speciﬁc aims of the proposal.

Subgroup 1 receptor tyrosine kinases-The subclass 1 growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases (1)
include the epidermal growth factor (EGF) rece tor, the neu/erbB2 tyrosine kinase (also designated
HERZ), the erbB3 protein (HER3), and the erbB (protein (HER4). Each of these proteins appear to be
comprised of a single olypeptide chain (Mr ~ 17 —180 kDa) that includes a cysteine-rich extracellular
(growth factor bin ingl; domain, a single membrane-spanning helix, and a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase
domain that contains a number of potential autophosphorylation sites. The ﬁrst important step in the
signaling pathways of these receptors is the translation of the growth factor binding event into the
activation of tyrosine kinase activity. An immediate outcome of this activation event is the
autophosphorylation of the rece tor which in turn serves to recruit cellular phosphosubstrates and initiate
signaling cascades that lead to t e nucleus. It has now been well establishe that roteins that contain the
src—homology region 2 (SH—2 domains) bind to the autophosphorylated growt factor rece tors. An
important challenge is to understand how these binding events initiate the various signaling pa ways that
emanate from a given receptor, as well as to identify other proteins that participate in these signaling
pathways and determine how these pathways are integrated to give a biological (growth) response.

Relevance of subgroup 1 receptor tyrosine kinases to lung cancer-

A number of lines of evidence have implicated subclass 1 receptors in different t pes of cancer. For
example, the am lification of the neu/erbBZ tyrosine kinase has been found in 15—40 0 of primary breast
carcinomas and 0% of ovarian carcinomas and appears to have a signiﬁcant redictive value for the
overall survival of patients with breast cancer (2). In various lung cancers, bot the EGF receptor and
neu/erbBZ have been found to be overexpressed (3,4). The presence of the EGF receptor to a significantly

eater extent in non-small-cell lung cancer and squamous carcinomas com ared to non—squamous tumors
3) has been demonstrated. The levels of EGF receptor were related to e sta e of spread of the lung
tumors. In fact, the demonstration of a high concentration of EGF receptor in e worst prognosis non-
small-cell lung cancer led to the suggestion that this receptor, or components of its signaling pathway,
might serve as a potential target for therapy (3). It also as been suggested that the expression of the
neu/erbBZ tyrosine kinase in lung cancers is of potential prognostic importance (4). Expression of
neu/erbBZ occurs in both squamous cell carcinomas and adenocarcinomas of the lung and at higher levels
than in uninvolved bronchiolar epithelium; moreover, in adenocarcinomas, the expression of neu/erbB2 is
independently associated with a shortened survival.

Mechanisms of receptor activation and aberrant signaling-

Obviously a key question concerns how the overexpression (or amplification) of these receptor
tyrosine kinases leads to uncontrolled cell growth. The detection of normal basal mucosal stainin in the
lun for EGF receptor (3) led to the suggestion that these stem cells of the mucosa may re uire GP for
pro iferation and differentiation to normal mucosal cells. If EGF receptor activity, and or neu/erbB2
activity, were necess for the normal growth of lung cells, then events that result in the overexpression
of these receptors con (1 elicit an overampllification of a growth signaling pathwap and thereb initiate
tumori enesis. It is tempting to speculate t at this may occur because increased leve s of the E0 receptor
or neu erbB2 would stimulate (in a growth factor inde endent manner) receptor-receptor interactions, A
number of lines of evidence now indicate that the a ilit of subgroup 1 receptor tyrosine kinases to
dimen'ze (i.e. form homodimers or heterodimers) provides or the initiation of diverse Signalin pathways.
For example, the formation of an EGF receptor-neu/erbBZ heterodimer results in an EC r—stimulated
tyrosine p osphorylation of the neu/erbBZ protein and enables the EGF receptor and neu/erbB2 to act
syner ’sncally to transform mouse ﬁbroblasts (5).

e have obtained evidence for another type of heterodimer formation, specificall between
neu/erbBZ and the erbB3 protein (6). These studies were initiated because of the ﬁndings that e putative
ligand (growth factor) for neu/erbB2, designated heregulin (also called neu differentiation factor) (7),
could bind to neu/erbBZ in some cells (cg. mammary carcinomas) but not all cells (ﬁbroblasts). Given
the tendency of the members of the subc ass 1 receptors to form heterodimers, it seemed possible that

Title of Original Grant: Modulation of nicotine-receptor channels

Abstract of the Speciﬁc Aims as stated in the original application:

Aim 1: Modulation of post synaptic nicotineﬁgtivated channels subtypes,

Aim 1 of the original application proposed to asess the differences amongst native neuronal nAChR
subtypes with respect to which subtypes are subject to modulation and which nAChR (1 subunits are
required for modulation. We proposed to examine the single channel properties and modulation of
nAChRs on primary neurons and then compare the behaviour of native nAChRs with those expressed by
"subunit deleted“ neurons (is. neurons treated with subunit-speciﬁc antisense oligonucleotides). This
analysis was to be complemented by studies of the modulation of nicotine activated channels made up of
particular on and B nAChR subunit cDNAs, expressed in Xenopus oocytes.

Experiments in Aim 2 were to examine the role of presynaptic nicotine receptor channels in the
modulation of synaptic function. Our preliminary experiments suggested that nicotine might augment the
release of fast excitiatory transmitters. We proposed that different subtypes of nAChRs might mediate
nicotine-induced synaptic facilitation, perhaps dependent on the targetting of speciﬁc subtypes to terminal
ﬁelds receiving co-incident cholinergic input. Aim 2 experiments proposed to extend our preliminary
ﬁndings by examination of both the molecular mechanism(s) and nicotine receptor subtypes responsible
for synaptic modulation in the CNS.

LONG—PATH INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY FOR AIR
POLLUTION RESEARCH

E. R. STEPHENS"

Franklin Institute Laboratories, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania

(Received 30 September 1960)

Abstract—Two long-path absorption cells have been designed and built for the measurement
of gaseous contaminants in the atmosphere and for the laboratory study of reactions occurring
in such atmospheres. These instruments are based on the White multiple-reﬂection system,
having two large mirrors of 3 m radius of curvature at one end of the cell and a smaller mirror

of the same radius at the other end.
To avoid excessive losses of radiant energy, the image of the infrared source is magniﬁed and

demagniﬁed to match the cell to the spectrometer. Optimum path for maximum absorption
signal is reached when reﬂection losses reduce the energy to l/e of its initial value. This cor-
responds to a path length of 120 m with the present cells although they have been successfully
used at paths several times this length. It is possible to detect and identify many contaminants
of importance in air pollution at concentrations of a few tenths of a part per million. The
absorptions of water vapor and carbon dioxide make some regions of the spectrum opaque,

but this interference is not serious over most of the spectrum.
The ﬁrst of these cells was used for laboratory studies in Philadelphia and the second was
mounted in a laboratory trailer and taken to southern California where it has been in use

since 1956 for the study of the atmosphere and related problems.

O.\'E of the most serious problems encountered in air pollution research is that of obtaining
adequate analytical methods. Often one must try to analyze a complex mixture whose
composition can only be guessed and in which the components of interest are present in
very minute amounts. Chemical methods applied to such a problem suffer from the short-
coming that serious interferences may be caused by components whose presence is not only
unknown but unsuspected. An example of this is the potassium iodide method used to
measure "oxidant” in the Los Angeles atmosphere. Although most of the so-called “oxi-
dant” is believed to be ozone, the question of how much of it might be other oxidizing
agents is Still unresolved.

To meet the need for more speciﬁc analytical methods for the many substances of interest
in air pollution. the Franklin Institute Laboratories have been developing the technique of
long-path infrared absorption spectroscopy.

The primary interest in this work, which is sponsored by the Smoke and Fumes Com-
mittee of the American Petroleum Institute, has always been the chemistry of air pollution
rather than optics. spectroscopy, or analytical methods per 56. For this reason, previous
publications (1—4) have emphasized the results of reaction studies and described only
superﬁcially the instrumentation used. This paper is written in the belief that more details

of the long-path infrared technique may be of interest.
