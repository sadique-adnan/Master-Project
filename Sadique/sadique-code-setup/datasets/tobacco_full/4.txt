FROM: Ralph Atlas

SUBJECT: LORILLARD SHELF PLAN REVISION

 

Attached is a copy of Lorillard's new carton shelf payment
schedule effective June 1, 1985.

The changes are as follows:

0 Top payment now is $104.00 per month. On previous contract
the payment was $119.00.

0 The lowest volume category (100-199) has been eliminated.

o In stores having only one standard fixture, "one full shelf"
is interpreted as either 12 or 16 rows per shelf, however,
in stores with multiple racks, "one full shelf" must
represent 16 rows, with extra rows being contiguous.

The purpose is to upgrade Lorillard's position in all stores when
they only occupy 12 rows to 16 rows. However, their
correspondence states that "if a retailer adamantly objects to
giving Lorillard the required additional rows, do not jeopardize
the arrangement -- we will grandfather those ocations."

MEMORANDUM
TO: Bill Buckley
FROM: Michael Brozek
RE: Daily Minnesota Update

__-___-____——______—_____——_______——-_____——____--—_.____--—__

Bill, as per your instruction, here is a report on our
progress with regard to legislative matters in the state of
Minnesota. For purposes of order, we will approach this report
from the aspects of legislative program and legislative support.

LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM:

As decided on Friday, April 26 in Minneapolis, at a meeting
attended by legislative counsels from the Tobacco Institute, R.
J. Reynolds and Philip Morris, which included Dale Florio of
Philip Morris and Kent Wold of R. J. Reynolds, specific
legislators were assigned to industry lobbyists for direct
lobbying contact. This activity is being monitored daily in
order to determine any shifts or progress in the Senate Finance
Committee and House Appropriations Committee. A meeting will be
held on Thursday, May 2 at 2:00 p.m. at the Capitol Rotunda in
St. Paul, in an attempt to document legislative responses and
comments. These meetings will be held daily until further
notice.

Tentatively, the Senate Finance Committee will meet Monday,
May 6 at 8:00 a.m., to hear testimony on the Senate version of

the cigarette tax/Health Department package (SF 776). A
representative of Covington and Burling, either Mr. Rupp or Mr.
Beder, will be on site to offer testimony at this hearing.
Additionally, Mr. Vernon Dempsey will be present for direct
legislative contact on Friday, May 3 in discussions concerning
the sampling issue.

An additional approach has been undertaken to deal directly
with the Attorney General's office, concerning a legal opinion to
the legislature, regarding the sampling ban portion of SF 776 and
HF 810. Legislative counsel Tom Kelm, in meetings with the
Justice Department, has requested review of this legislation
within the context of the federal preemption. It is understood
that these conversations have been, and will continue to be
confidential.

and Gas Station's as well as Cigarette Stores and Tax Differential outlets.
Package sales are still growing in Urban Special Emphasis Calls. The
Menthol packings are now becoming ﬁrmly established, and the 100 MM
packings are becoming the best sellers overall. We continue to enjoy an
average 10¢ price advantage in most retail outlets vs. Doral and GPC.

The Box packings continue to grow throughout the area. In many cases
Newport Box Parent outsells Newport Soft. Newport Light Box 80's
continue to experience excellent increases in sales and distribution. Most
retailers are maintaining larger inventories which aids in excellent
increased competitive trial. The Light Box 100's are also beneﬁting from
renewed trial.

Each of these brand families continue to decline in sales with the
exception of the Kent Heavy-Up in Region 17. This program allows Kent
to maintain sales.

Sales in Region 25 have decreased dramatically due to the elimination of
promotional support. Retailers report there are some brand loyal
consumers who are continuing to purchase the hrand without a coupon.

Clean-Up Program achieved our objectives, and the buy-down in the
volume accounts moved the remaining inventory through in a timely

Summary of 6908 Activities for 1989

Oriental Tobacco Studies

A.

A study of the effect of agronomic variables on preformed TSNA and
MS smoke TSNA from oriental tobacco was concluded. Samsun and
bright (McNair 373) tobaccos were grown under bright conditions,
and effects of topping, flue-curing and sun-curing were studied.
When filler TSNA levels were taken into consideration, the agro-
nomic variables had a very substantial influence on the transfer/
pyrosynthesis phenomena leading to the observed levels of TSNA in
MS smoke.26 Sun-curing gave much lower levels of preformed TSNA
than flue-curing. The lowest levels of MS TSNA relative to TPM
were delivered by the sun-cured and not-topped Samsun tobacco.

A pilot study was carried out on the relationship of chemical
characteristics of different oriental varieties to the levels of
endogenous TSNA found and MS TSNA produced when corresponding

cigarettes were smoked. There were significant variations in both
endogenous TSNA and MS TSNA among the three varieties.27

Based on the results of the pilot study described above, an
expanded study of eight oriental varieties was completed except
for final data analysis. Wide ranges in the levels of various
components were observed depending on the country of origin as
well as grade designation in some cases. Only two varieties had
levels of endogenous TSNA typical of those found in blended
oriental fillers. Very low endogenous TSNA values were observed
for the other varieties. The variety found to yield the highest
level of MS TSNA was not the one which had the highest levels of
endogenous'll'SNA.28

Samples of American Aromatic Tobacco (AAT) that were grown in 1985
under bright conditions with air-curing were obtained from Roger
Bass (Project 2525). AAT originated%from crosses between a South
American tobacco, a bright variety, and a burley. The TSNA levels
were lower than those found for a typical burley, but higher than
those found normally for oriental. NAT levels were considerably
higher than NNN levels in all these samples, while NNK levels were
low as is normal for burley. Endogenous TSNA tended to be propor-
tional to abienol levels in the five different crosses tested,
with some exceptions.29

Mr. J.J. Morgan Dam: September 18, 1980

Marketing Research Department

Cigarette Brand Shares — July 1980

July's Industry sales were off 4.3% versus 1979 (— 6.3% calendar
adjusted) due to a price increase last year. Likewise, reflecting the
price increase, year—to—date Industry figures were 1.1% below 1979
levels, and 1.4% behind when calendar adjusted. Year—to-date comparisons
through August are expected to be more representative of the Industry's
performance.

Philip Morris (30.9) recorded a slight decline for the month, as did
Brown & Williamson (13.6). R.J. Reynolds (32.7), affected by the
combination of the discontinuation of Winston Menthol 100's, Salem Box,
Real and Tempo, and the national introduction of Salem Ultras, had

a small increase. American (10.7) and Lorillard (9.8) also gained some
share. Liggett & Myers (2.3) remained unchanged.

Among the leading brands, Marlboro (17.7) retreated from last month's
high. Declines were also evident in Winston (13.2) and K001 (8.9).

Salem (9-1) enjoyed the largest increase due to the launch of Salem
Ultras (0.6). Other gainers included Merit (4.3), Kent (5.0) and Camel
(4.3). B & H 100's (4.4), Pall Mall (5.2) and Vantage (3.7) held steady.

The Low Tar category tar level groups (Chart 6) have been revised from
0-5mg. and 6-9mg., to O—6mg. and 7—9mg., respectively, to include Vantage
Ultra Lights (6mg.) and Salem Ultras (5mg. Kings, 6mg. 100's) in the
Ultra Low Tar category.

The Low Tar category (41.5) surged in July aided by new Salem Ultra.

Low Tar 80/85‘5 (24.3), Low Tar IOU/120's (17.3) and Menthol Low Tar (13 0)
all registered share increases. The Non—Menthol Low Tar category (28.6)

was unchanged. Among the recent new Low Tar entries, Cambridge and Now 100's

recorded .3 shares, and Carlton 100‘s Box had a .1 share.

Of the other major categories, Total Menthol (28.9) and Total 100's (31.8)
increased. Total 80/85‘5 (58.1) declined slightly.

the tape has been 5 ared with councilmembers in Rancho Mirage,
California, and was presented at an ETS seminar in Harrisburg,
Pennsylvania.

This information will be helpful to your colleagues. You may
have found a use for this reSource that could be helpful

MEMORANDUM
September 24, 1993
TO: W. R. Deaton
FROM: E. F. DeLaura
RE: Panel Results: Harley Lights 100 MM RﬁD #1385-6/93

Attached are the Low Tar panel results for The Harley Lights
V IOOMM proto.

Results for the previously reported Harley Lights V 85 MM
and the Regular brand are also shown as a source of

reference.

Just to note, the Regular brand testing in which these Low
Tar NM panel members tested their own brand blinded, will
serve as benchmark data in this and subsequent/panel memos.

The Regular brand results represent the "ideal ratings" as
most respondents were extremely favorable in their

evaluations for their regular brand (in test).

Product Specs are as follows:

Harley Lts. 100 MM 9.8 mgs. tar .71 mgs. nic.
Harley Lts. 85 MM 8.5 mgs. tar .66 mgs. nic.
Conclusions

The Harley Lts. 100 MM proto (1385-6-93) attained an average
acceptance of 6.5 among total respondents. While the
product scored well among 100 MM and smokers 30 years of age
and over, it netted out poorly with the 85 MM smokers and

those 18 to 29 years of age.

The 85 MM proto (1592/93-93) fared better in total, 6.8, and
among all sub groups. Of note is how the 18-29 year old
smokers rated all three products the lowest of all the

sub-groups.
(See Table 1)

Product Performance
Total Smokers

The key problem with Harley Lts. 100 MM is its "too
light/not strong enough" taste. It was not cited as overly
harsh tasting or having an unpleasant aftertaste.

SUBJ ECT: WWW -- Agency Development Brief.

The following outlines the information that is to be incorporated into the Management
Materials for Project RX.

mm

As the penny profit generated from sales of RX is less than those realized from the sale of
full margin brands and, in some instances, deep discount brands, the focus of the ”sell story"
for RX will be one based on consumer demand for the product. ln essence, consumer
demand for RX will be so strong that retailers not carrying the product will be at a
competitive disadVantage, To support this argument, key learnings from the RX Ad-pack
research (such as purchase interest), as well as a few "memorable" consumer quotes from
focus groups and one—on-oncs, will be incorporated into the sales materials.

The actual sell in brochure should be a printed 4 page, 4 color piece that contains 'a pocket for
introductory allowance worksheets, pricing worksheets P. 0.8. menu items etc.

4 R ER HUR‘E

The following details the element‘s which are to be included on the sales brochure in priority
order:

1) ﬂ Proposition

First and foremost, retailers must be educated as simply as possible as to what RX
is all abouL They must clearly understand it's positioning as every bit a Marlboro that
because its shorter costs less.

While retail pricing is obviously a critical element to the success of RX, the brand's
desired absolute r'ctzrilpricin g of RX should not be printed on the actual 4 color brochure.
Instead, suggested retail pricing will be handled on: a separate worksheet insert so that
salesreps can adjust pricingm an account by account basis (see example)

2) Se ll S to [y

Involving and straight-fonvard copy that "sells" the retail trade on the strong consumer
demand RX will {li‘nrjmlt‘ and how important it‘is Ural Ire/she carry the product is the
foundation of the. safer: 523%}: and must he boldly communicated.

. STATUS REPORT

Phases I and II of the Marlboro Standardization effort
(interviews and investigations) were completed in May, I985. We
visited each of our locations and held group discussions with
supervision to explain our objectives and to hear their concerns.
These group discussions as well as individual interviews were used to
gather knowledge about Marlboro and to gain an insight into suSpected
influences on cigarette subjective response.

Locations Visited

Cigarette Manufacturing Centers-
Louisville (including the ES/ESB Plant)
Cabarrus ‘
Manufacturing Center (including DIET processing)
Stockton Street (including ET processing)

Processing‘Plants-

Dock Street

DMCP

BL Plant

Park 500

Richmond Stemmery
Flavor Center

We are beginning Phase III of the Marlboro Standardization effort
(implementation). During the week of June 3rd each cigarette
manufacturing center will produce "Standard" Marlboro Long Size and
King Size cigarettes. The exception to normal production is that each
cigarette manufacturing center will use material from the same lots of
"Standard Product" as supplied by our Processing Plants. Prior to June
3, 1985, each‘ of our Processing Plants will produce the required
amounts of "Standard Product" to be used for Marlboro production.

Analytical evaluation of these cigarette will be conducted by
R&D. .

To support the subjective evaluations, an 0/C Marlboro Panel was
organized in February, 1985. This panel of 48 Marlboro smokers is
evaluating production Marlboro from cigarette pick-ups from‘ each
cigarette manufacturing center to develop‘ procedures and baseline
data.

SUBJECT: Promotional Lift Analysis

Attached is the most recent Marlboro promotion analysis. It contains the lift numbers
for the March price off. As i explained on the phone, the analysis uses statistical
modeling to estimate weekly share lifts in stores carryjng the promotion in a given
week, it does n_ot measure the total market performance of the promotion. The reason
for modeling is to allow comparison of promotions on an “all else being equal" basis.
Needless to say, in the marketplace all else is rarely equal. Still I hope this is useful.

Subject: . Meeting Minutes - Park 500 NPDES Permit

A meeting was held at Park 500 on August 14 at 2:00 to
discuss the draft NPDES wastewater discharge permit received
from the State Water Control Board.

Attendees:
G. L. Hill W. E. Poorbaugh
B. E. Honts J. N. Tenhet
J. J. Petchul J. T. White

W. P. Pitts

The following is a brief summary of the major issues dis-
cussed at the meeting. Any attendee wishing to correct or
add to these minutes should contact the author.

1. Phosphorus (P) is the only controlled parameter which
has both a mass (in pounds) and a concentration (in
parts per million) limit. Together, these two limits
place a cap on our maximum flow. The P concentration
limit is fixed by state regulation at 2.0 mg/L but we
should ask the SWCB to drop the P mass limit or
increase it if we plan to increase our flow.

2. The question concerning growth at Park 500 and waste-
water plant expansion for the next five years must be
addressed immediately. Unless we request additional
flow in September, we will be committed to our existing
flow of 2.2 mgd. This will very likely prevent any
expansion at Park 500 unless another permit is negoti-
ated and possibly until more wastewater treatment
capacity is added. state rules and attitudes and Park
500’s physical situation have all changed in the last
year. Three years ago we were able to start construc-
tion on the Bermuda Project without waiting nine months
for a permit. We will not be able to do that again.

It is important to use this occasion to expand Park
500’s treatment capacity if there will be justifiable
need in the next five years.

FROM: Samuel D. Chilcote, Jr.

Administrative Law Judge Vitonne yesterday presided over the
opening day of the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration’s (OSHA) scheduled 11-week hearings on the
proposed indoor air quality standard. OSHA staff testified in

the morning; the balance of the day was consumed by a cross—
examination period.

Dr. Michael Silverstein, OSHA's director of policy, expressed the
Agency's intent to use the information obtained at the hearing to
"assure that the final rule is effective." Noting that ETS
issues had received a disproportionate amount of pre-hearing
attention, Silverstein stressed that tobacco is only one of many
airborne "hazards" OSHA would address in the final rule. He
denied any political motivation for the rulemaking.

John Martonik, acting director of health standards programs for
OSHA, stressed that the regulation would not ban smoking, but
only restrict smoking to separately exhausted smoking areas under
negative pressure so that nonsmoking coworkers are "protected ...
from the adverse health effects of ETS." Martonik estimated that
4.4 million buildings and 70.7 million workers would be affected

by the rUle. Compliance with the IAQ standard is estimated at
$8.1 billion.

Following the opening statements, nearly a dozen individuals
acknowledged their intent to cross-examine OSHA staffers. The
questions, primarily from tobacco industry representatives,
sought to clarify matters ranging from the scope of the rule to
the research the Agency cited to support the proposed action.
Following one lengthy exchange, Agency staffers stated that the

rule as written does not preempt state and local laws
banning/restricting smoking.

AVERAGE DAILY CONSUMPTION‘RATE

 

For 1982, smokers of the major Lorillard brands (Newport, Newport ;
Lights, Kent, Golden Lights, Kent III, and True) smoke an average 1;;
of 34.1 cigarettes per day. This figure takes reported consumption .1},

Golden Lights 1
Kent III

True . 1

B&H Heavy Spending

This is the final report evaluating the B&H Heavy—up test which began in
August 1984 in Shreveport, Seattle, Lubbock and Fresno. October
will be the last month of data reported due to the Merit Box

introduction in November which took most of the available media that
month.

Spending Levels

While spending for the total brand has doubled, the increase is applied
to Lights in Lubbock and Fresno, and DUL in Seattle and Shreveport. As
such, spending on those packings has essentially tripled, while spending
on the remaining packings has changed very little. Below is a summary
of the spending in each market.

Current indexed to previous 190 194 194 190

Market Share

After three months of data, this test cannot be adequately evaluated.
However, at this point in time, the extra spending has had no effect on
B&H. Share changes in the test markets as well as the total U.S. are
insignificant (confidence interval is 95%).

Discussions with Max Hahsermann

My discussions with Dr. Hausermann‘covered the following
areas:

1. Flutedlplastic tip‘on the Parliament 100
2. Flush fluted filter development program
3. Microreticulated polymer program

In regard to the fluted Parliament 100 tip, our discussion
was very brief. Dr. Hansermann stated that the various

>filter components he had‘requested from us andlManufacturing

had been received. He was specificalby interested in learning
more details about the cutter designs used on the dual

combiner and cigaret assembler. I referred him to Manufacturing
for details;

Dr. Hansermann stated that FTR was extremely interested in
getting ou+ an entirely new product and it was his feehing that
the flush fhuted filter could provide the basis for such a
cigaret. I showedlhim the extrusion process and hater dis-
cussedithe benefits to he derived when this type filter was
used in combination with a carbon on tow inner plug, e.g.,
Philip Morris Multifilter type. Dr. Haﬁsermann indicated

that FTR would probabhy be interested in purchasing an
extrusionlline. I obtained from Gatto the name of their German
subsidiary from which equipment, identical to ours, could be
purchased. (Later in the day Dr. Seligman‘suggestedlthat FTR
might be able/to arrange a transfer of one of Manufacturingis
extrusion lines to Switzerland and then order another line

for themselves. He suggested Dr. Waltz explore this possibihity
through proper company channels.) If they do obtain a line

Dr. Hausermann suggested that I go to Switzerland to assist
them in starting up‘their process. (I HEARTILY CONCUR!)

Dr. Hausermann‘said that FTR would pay all my expenses;

I discussed with Dr. Hatsermann the devehopment of our PVC
filter material and the problems we were having with scaling
the process from lab to pilot stage. We discussed in some
detail possible approaches for cooling the fused material.

He felt that cooling the material on a belt containing molds
of the same basic configuration as our quartz tubes was a good
approach. Before leaving Richmond he phoned me and suggested
the possibility of extruding microporous fibers. I explained
the difficulties which wouldlbe involved in such‘an approach.

,_

At the end of our conversation he noted that the time spent
in the Cigaret Devehopment Division was 0f greatest beneﬁit

to him and the most interesting of his current tripgg’

Subsequent to our discussions of July 14, I have reviewed the
Tobacco Institute of Japan (TIOJ) regulations and our T&N data. The
TIOJ tolerances require that verification values be within 1 20% of

the printed values on the package.

We notified P81 in March (copy attached) that our initial values
were 1 mg "tar" and 0.1 mg nicotine lower than our printed values;
931 recently advised R. Hammer that TIOJ’s data confirmed our
results. The data for our May/June runs (attached) correspond

exactly to our printed values.

At Lorillardm 5 request, the agency prepared three print spreads
for True Laser. These ads differed from previous ones in that
more emphasis was placed onwproduct copy;

The purpose of this:research was to‘determine each adds stopping
power, persuasive ability and communicative content.

This study required four* separate cells of two hundred smokers.
Each ad was exposed through the standardeO-ad portfolio.
Eligible respondents were random smokers, 18e64 years of age.
Quotas were established so that half were male and half female.
Interviews were conducted in the following ten markets: Akron,
Baton‘Rouge, Detroit, Fresno, Hicksvillew Indianapolis,
Middletown, Phoenix, Tampa and Washington.

* The sole purpose of the fourth cell was to determine the
Level of incorrect brand notingxtspecifically Merit) caused by
the "ﬁewsprint"‘ad. To get a clean read" a vantage ad‘was
substituted for the Merit control. This was an abbreviated cell
in that diagnostic information was not required.

Recommendation

Reference is made to the attached subjective evaluation results, which were
very conclusive and in favor of a total elimination of both urea and ammonia

rather than urea only.

For all blends in the EU region we, therefore, recommend to discontinue the
usage of FtLB and BL, in favor of the utilisation of FlLE and Cast Leaf.

lmglementation considerations and strategy

1. Priority will be given to production for Nonivay. As of the November 99-
production, implement the ML PE blend with CL and RLE for FF, MED and
Lights in MUC/FTR. There is no impact on tobacco weight. For Merit and
Merit Ultra, production at FTR, the project Hill blend standardisation using
CL/RLE is recommended. It should be noted that also production of CH
Domestic and Duty Free are to follow to ensure sufficient volumes to use
full batches of filler. A weight saving is foreseen. Sufficient cast leaf to
support this production will be supplied ex Bremen to FTR.

2. Second priority will be given to production for UK. In view of production
volumes and availability of cast leal, production can only begin in

Statistical Processing of H.T.I. Test Data

As we discussed over the phone, this memo requests that your Department
develop the capability to routinely perform various computer statistical

analyses of H.T.I. product test data tapes for the Market Research
Department.

We are all pleased about the progress your group has made along with

that of Tom Budne in the development of improved and more sophisticated
statistical analyses of product test data. Now that this work is being
done on a routine basis for P.O.L. tests, it seems worthwhile expanding
this system to cover H.T.I. There are several advantages in Richmond's
performing the same statistical analyses on H.T.I. and P.O.L. data.

The first is greater comparability in evaluating product tests results.
Another is that any improvements your Department, Tom Budne or the Market

Research Department make in these analyses can be shared. Finally, the
proprietary nature of such statistical analyses will be preserved.

Let me know at your earliest convenience how best we can implement such
a program. .

Thank you for your cooperation.

MEMORANDUM
October 3, 1984
TO: A. B. Hudson
FROM: E. P. Farrell
RE: KENT 2000 100's (9mg.) (#1464—84) — TEST SUMMARY

Two LT products have recently been put through the Starch
National Smokers Panel, they are:

— Marlboro Lts. 100's
— Kent 2000 100's (9mg.) (#1464-84)

The Kent 2000 product is different from the 12 mg., PM taste
alike or the 12 mg. sweet product evaluated through consumer
product testing. The Kent 2000 product (#1464—84) is closely
associated with the 12 mg. PM taste alike, however.

As a possible diagnostic aid the Kent M2 product was explored,
once again.

To review all three products were paneled among samples of 246
Lo-Fi/LT smokers. All three samples were balanced to provide
equal representation of the following dimensions:

- Age

— Sex

— Region

- Regular Brand by Packing

CONCLUSIONS

0 The Kent 2000 IOOMM product (#1464-84) demonstrated notable
deficiencies relative to Marlboro Lts. 100's on most
measures including:

— Average satisfaction ratings
- Purchase likelihood
— Satisfaction relative to current brand

— Product directionals

I These lapses in Kent 2000's performance spanned most
relevant user groups: Lo-Fi/LT, BS's/lOO's and
manufacturers. The one exception was Kent 2000's greater
satisfaction rating among Kent smokers than that achieved

by Marlboro Lt. 100's.

MEMORANDUM

January 20, 1993
TO: M. S. Ireland
FROM: A. Prakash

SUBJECT: Analysis of Phenols in an Experimental Cigarette Sample
Made With Brown Wrapping Paper and Compared to the
Reference Cigarette, 1725—89 (PROJECT B 451 CMP)

Phenols in the mainstream smoke of 85 mm straight cigarette
sample, submitted by J. H. Bell, were quantitated by HPLC (l).
The sample cigarettes were made of brown wrapping paper. An
earlier memorandum (2) on phenol results for the brown paper
cigarettes is invalid since the sample was incorrectly identi—

fied.

Three cigarettes per pad were smoked by a single port smoking
machine in J. H. Bell’s laboratory. The Cambridge pad containing
the particulates of the mainstream smoke was extracted with 20 ml
of isopropanol from the smoking laboratory. The isopropanol
extract was diluted with equal volume of 6% aqueous acetic acid
and analyzed for phenols. Results of the analyses are presented
in Tables I and II.

A review of the results based on wet tar suggested lower hydro-
quinone levels in the brown paper cigarettes compared to the
reference, 1725—89. The results of the brown paper cigarettes
were not consistent as seen from the relative standard deviations
being greater than 25%, whereas the control showed a relative
standard deviation 4—7%.

PARLIAMENT PACKAGING MODIFICATIONS — CONSUMER REACTIONS

I would just like to mention for the record that we
have only received two letters from consumers to date
containing reactions to our Parliament packaging
modifications, and both of these were unfavorable.

Additionally, we have only received one letter which
must have been in reaction to the carton stuffers,
which stated that that consumer preferred the old

Subject: SAM-Project Tomorrow Development Qrtly

 

This memo summarizes the efforts of the Development Team for the ﬁrst quarter 1994. The
attached spreadsheet and graphs will summarize the current estimated manpower allocation and
budget status.

ﬁgmess Engineering and Material Testing

Replaced nylon tracks and modiﬁed metal shims to eliminate dripping on MOD. Machine
runnability was greatly improved during a performance run conducted on 3/17/94.

Munising IV trials were conducted 3/7/94 to 3/23/94. Twenty-ﬁve banded papers were
produced. Papers made of Avicel with 0% CMC had processing problems. The matrix was
run with models containing Avicel with 4% and 8% CMC. Cigarettes made from these papers
are in support of the cigarette design model.

MOD trials were conducted on 4/5/94 to 4/7/94 (outside end of ﬁrst quarter but included by
default ). The slurries consisted of 15 Eucalyptus and 2 Aspen wood pulps. A third Aspen
paper was not produced due to slurry reﬁnement problems. Cigarettes made from these papers
are in support of the cigarette design model.

KC has indicated that they are considering 3% CMC, 6% PVOH, 3% Na Alginate, and 3%
Na Alginate plus Acid as their industry samples for banded papers using the gravure process.
KC shipped bobbins on 13 April. The papers and cigarettes will begin evaluation/fabrication
starting May.

Worked diligently to get KC on board with project management. Both parties have agreed to
a monthly format. KC’s manpower allocations continue to be a major concern. The goals and
objectives of this project will be greatly jeopardized if these resources are not in place by
April 22 ,1994.

Measurements and Methods Development

Trials on the rewinder table indicate that band inspection results are largely independent of
rewinding speeds ( 67 to 295 m/rnin ). However, banded paper in which the slurry contained
20% calcium carbonate showed increased difﬁculty in band detection. DCS Corp. is working
to optimize the signal to noise ratio. PM will also continue to evaluate additional banded
paper conﬁgurations for detection anomalies.

The Fidus built PPM 400 ( used to measure permeability of cigarette papers from .5 to 50 +/-
.1 Coresta) is working well . This instrument is currently used to verify paper permeability
during and after mill trials. Conversations with R&D and QA users with regards to
modiﬁcations for commercialization are forthcoming.

MINIMUM SALES AGE FOR CIGARETTES IN PENNSYLVANIA

This memorandum responds to the February 18, 1993
letter from Richard A. Lewis, District Attorney for Dauphin
County, Pennsylvania, to Ernest D: Preate, Jr., Attorney General
of Pennsylvania, in which Mr. Lewis requests that the Attorney
General issue a formal opinion addressing the minimum sales age
for cigarettes in Pennsylvania. Mr. Lewis suggests that

Pennsylvania law prohibits the sale of cigarettes to persons

under the age of 21. He notes that Section 6306 of the Crimes
Code, 18 Pa. C.S. § 6306, prohibits the sale of cigarettes to
"any minor," and that the Statutory Construction Act, 1 Pa. C.S.

§ 1991, defines a "minor? as "an individual under the age of 21

years."

In fact, the minimum sales age for cigarettes has been
18 since 1990, when Section 6305 of the Crimes Code, 18 Pa. C.S.
§ 6305, was amended to raise the minimum sales age for "tobacco,
in any form," from 16 to 18. The minimum sales age for
cigarettes, as for other tobacco products, previously was 16, as

specified in Section 6305 prior to the 1990 amendment.

The District Attorney's reliance on the Statutory

Construction Act is misplaced. That Act itself provides that the

definitions contained in Section 1991 apply only when the context

does not "clearly indicate[ ] otherwise." 1 Pa. C.S. § 1991: see

Attached is the version of SB. 55 approved by the Senate Health & Human Services
Committee It is an improvement over the original bill that you reviewed previously.
Deleted 13 the ban on outdoor advertising and the provision that would have prohibited an
adult consumer from redeeming a coupon in a face— to-face transaction. Also,
administration has been moved from the Department of Health to the State Comptroller 5
ofﬁce, which is a much better agency for enforcement of this law.

This bill, however, still has two major problems:

1) A self-serve ban. 1

2) A 10% tax on outdoor tobacco advertising to pay for a tobacco education media
campaign plus expanding the state's current outdoor advertising ban from 500 to 1,000 feet
from a church or school.

The bill also has the 27 year old carding requirement.

Please review this latest version and let me know if you identify other major concerns that
we need to address.

SUBJECT: Revi Incremental Production Costs/Paper to Vinyl

The attached details the revised incremental "production" costs associated with a conversion
to vinyl for the various PM bulletin pools. The additional costs for transportation and art
(less separation savings) are now included. Importantly, costs have actually declined
slightly for the Corporate pool versus those presented on Monday, while Marlboro costs

have increased nominally.

Separation charges, which average $5,000 per design, will be eliminated when converting
to vinyl production. The savings applies only to the Corporate pool, given that Marlboro
separation charges were included in the Marcann paper printing costs. As a result, minor
increases in transportation costs due to heavier weight for vinyl was more than offset by
signiﬁcant savings due to the elimination of separation charges for the Corporate pool.
Below is a breakdown of the revised incremental costs per unit per cycle for both pools.

, INCREMENTAL CCSTSZQ NITZCYCLE

Marlboro " Original 3mm
14 x 48 $ 78 $ 90

20 x 60 281 3 12
Corporate

19.6 X 48 119 101

20 x 60 69 - 282

Note that it is now cost effective to produce the 20 x 60 Corporate pool on vinyl vs. paper !

Fiscal 1994 and full year '95 revised incremental production costs for vinyl are outlined on
the attached. Total incremental Marlboro pool production costs for ﬁscal 1994 totals
$57,000 while the Corporate pool totals an incremental $21,000 for ﬁscal '94 (or $5m per

brand for the 4 cycles).

Assuming brand approval, we Will proceed with the conversion effective
with the November posting for Virginia Slims in the Corporate pool and for
Marlboro in the 14 x 48 and 20 x 60 pools. We will also coordinate viewing for
the vinyl/paper "test” which will be available for viewing in Maspeth, Queens during the

week of June 27th.

Thomas J. Collamore one: April 21, 1995
James C. Botticelli

Alan Blum

It is somewhat difficult to give you anything deﬁnitive that Blum may
bring up at the shareholders meeting, but I'll attempt a stab.

He's rather mercurial in his style, so he really can come up with
anything. In the past, he has not been as combative as some of the
other anti's (certainly not like the Connolly's, Slade's et a1), and tries to
come across as a "good" guy, often complimenting PM on its hospitality
in Richmond, etc. I ﬁnd him more an irritant, attempting to
embarrass us, than, say, the institutional shareholders, who are
pushing for dramatic change. This will be his seventh annual meeting.

He founded the group Doctors Ought to Care (DOC). It's a national
physicians' anti-tobacco group that is especially fond of protesting
tobacco-sponsored sporting groups. It targeted Virginia Slims
Tournament one year, calling it Emphysema Slims. DOC has been
trying to bring in religious allies to its cause.

Blum likes to twist or exaggerate things. He has accused us of
suborning the minority community. For example, he said the reason
Blacks rarely criticized the tobacco industry on smoking and health
issues was because we were "buying them off' with our charitable
contributions. Blum was also the person who, just before the 1992
Republican Convention, released our internal memoranda regarding
political contributions. At the time he tried to embarrass us by saying
that we are "buying" politicians with our PAC support and that Craig,
as Convention Chairman, is further evidence of how we get to
politicians. If we support a youth organization, he‘ll say our ulterior
motive is really to get kids to smoke, or, if we sponsor a promotion,
he'll say we are really trying to circumvent restrictions on TV
advertising.

As far as I can recall, he has never put forward a shareholder
resolution, but has seconded or commented on many others. We
reviewed the transcripts of the past several years' annual meetings,
and he has seconded or commented on the following resolutions -
economic conversion (1994), cigarette advertising (1993), global
warning labels (1993/91), marketing of Miller beer (1992/91),
cigarettes and minors (1990). This year, I suspect he may be
interested in Proposal 2 - E’I‘S; maybe 3, primarily because it attempts
to get us out of the tobacco business; and 5, economic conversion,
since he seconded last year.

Subject: Smoke-Fm; Twenty-two Menthol ﬂigargﬂg

The product "Smoke-Free Twenty-two Menthol" submitted by Judy Smith, was ~
analyzed for the determination of nicotine, glycerin, PG and menthol. A non-mentholated
version of Smoke-Free Twenty-Two was analyzed previously for the same components.‘
The product is packaged as five "pellets" of a tobacco-like material. One pellet is inserted into
the tip end of a plastic ﬁlter holder resembling a hollow cigarette rod and is puffed upon. i

The product was assembled and "puff " for forty consecutive 35 ml puffs to determine
the presence of any released components in the vapor state. Nicotine, PG, glycerin and
menthol vapors released through puffing on a 5-port smoking machine were trapped and
analyzed following a previously established procedure.’ The components released by dry
puffing were analyzed by gas chromatography. The results generated from the menthol version
are compared to results from the non-menthol version reported previously are shown below:

The pellets were analyzed by capillary gas chromatography. Analysis for glycerin, PG, ;
menthol, and TA showed no within and between carton differences. Comparisons of these
components to Twenty-Two (Regular) showed greatest difference in menthol levels.

Virginia Slims Lights 120's Test Markets

The following updates Virginia Slims 120's performance in the Portland,
Oregon and Nashville test markets. Initial shipments began February 21,
1985. Introduction at retail commenced March 4, 1985.

This report now includes Virginia Slims' expansion into the combined
markets of Oklahoma City/Tulsa, as well as Kansas City.

Since May, data has been influenced by unusual industry buying patterns due
to price increase buying.

Market Share

Based on available data sources, during the latest 4 weeks, Virginia Slims
120's appears to have stabilized around the .8 level in Nashville, while in
Portland, Oregon the brand is fluctuating between the .2 to .4 level, for

both MSA and ICC data.

Nashville

- Factory shipments appear to be holding at the .5 level, based on
the latest 4 week average. Subsequent to the initial sell-in,

shipments have also averaged around the .5 level.
- Distributor sales (ICC) remain constant at the .8 level.

- Virginia Slims 120's averaged a 1.1 share at the retail level
over the latest 4 weeks. To date, the product has consistently
averaged around the 1.1 level. Realize share data is based on a
panel reflecting 100% distribution.

- The product has achieved a distribution level of 82% (SPACE 6/85).

Portland

- Based on the last 4 weeks, factory shipments have dipped from the
previously reported .4 level to a .2.

- ICC appears to have stabilized around the .3 level.

- A distribution level of 84% is being maintained.

HTI Test Of Two Virginia Slims Packages; Box Vs. Current Soft Pack
(Project No. 8718/8719)

r

The purpose of this test was to determine the degree of consumer interest
in a box version of Virginia Slims relative to the current soft pack. To
this end five packs each of experimental Virginia Slims Box and produc—

tion Virginia Slims Soft Pack were mailed to 325 women (125 were Virginia
Slims smokers, and 200 were smokers of ”other” 100mm non-menthol filters).
About two weeks after receiving their cigarettes, each woman was contacted
via telephone and interviewed with regard to her: 1) overall preference,

2) package preference, and 3) whether or not she noted any differences
between the cigarettes themselves.

It should be kept in mind that the Virginia Slims cigarettes used in both
packages were identical with regard to all qualitative characteristics

except overall cigarette length (the cigarettes in the experimental box
were about 2mm shorter).

 

SUMMARY/DISCUSSION

Overall preference was about equal between the Virginia Slims

in the soft pack and those in the box (49/51 for Virginia Slims
smokers and 54/46 for smokers of ”other” 100mm non-menthols).

The reasons for overall preference were based mainly on perceived
differences between the cigarettes rather than package differences.

The majority of women who gave a packaging reason for their over—
all choicei voted in favor of the box.

When questioned directly as to their preferences between the

i
l
g
3
packages2 the women indicated that the box was preferred over
the soft pack (70/30 by Virginia Slims smokers and 61/39 by
cross-section smokers). It was also found that each type of
package possessed its own, unique attributes:
Box: ”Cigarettes didn’t crush/Box protected them?” ”No 10956
tobaCCO/Neat/Not Messy,” "Cigarettes didn't fall out,”
"Keeps cigarettes fresh/moist/not dry.”
1

Soft Pack: ”Fits better into pocket or purse, ” ”Fits better
into cigarette case” ”Smaller/Not Bulky.”

Finally, when asked about the differences between the cigarettes
themselves. the women in both smoker groups tended to believe

that those cigarettes in the soft pack were ”milder/less harsh”
than those in the box.

Generally, we conclude that box packaging is preferred to the
soft paper pack by a majority of women 100mm smokers. However,
this preference is a ”weak” one, in that it had little impact
on overall preference. Also it appears that cigarettes packed

in the traditional soft paper package are perceived as being
”milder/less harsh” than those packaged in the hard box.

Urea Replacement Program—~Preliminary Outline

While working with Dr. Swain on the RL improvement project, we
tried various valeric acids, both alone and in combinations, at
several levels. We also tried them as their ammonium salts to increase
their solubilities to give more uniformity as well as to give a
source of ammonia. Because of the low level of those salts that can

be used to give the optimum taste effect, very little ammonia is added
to the filler.

While in Argentina, 1 injected some of their Marlboro cigarettes
with ammonium hydroxide on the last day there. Those who smoked the
injected cigarettes agreed that the cigarettes were smoother, more
salivating, and tasted more like our U.S. Marlboros. As this was
tried my last day in Argentina, we could not explore it any further,
but it seemed to confirm my thinking that some of the better taste of
RCB compared with RL may be due to the presence of ammonia or compounds
formed that will generate ammonia on pyrolysis.

On my return we tried ammonium acetate, ammonium carbonate,
ammonium carbamate, and ammonium lactate in #544 blend Marlboro cigar~
ettes containing no urea in the RL. The ammonium carbonate and
ammonium acetate were harsher and drier tasting while the ammonium
carbamate and ammonium lactate were smoother and more salivating.

Dr. Swain requested pilot plant samples of RL made with the
carbamateand lactate salts. We should also evaluate samples made with
these salts incorporated in the aftercutting solution to compare the
retention of the ammonia on the filler when added at the end of the
proceSsing versus that when incorporated in the RL.

If the samples made by incorporating the salts in the sheet or the
aftercutting solution confirm the positive results obtained by injection,
we should screen the ammonium salts of other organic acids such as
gluconic, tartaric, pectic, malic, citric, etc., which have FDA GRAS
status. Even ammonium salts of some amino acids should be screened,

although glycine may be the best one from cost and availability consider—
ations.

We should review all past work done on RCB to determine what
reaction products containing ammonia and/or nitrogenous compbund
precursors are generated in the production of RCB. If such information
is not available, we should initiate a study to give us that information.
We should also compare the nitrogen—containing pyrolysis products of
RCB with those of RL with and without urea, ammonia, and various ammonium
salts. Such studies should give us clues as to whether it is ammonia
and/or reaction products generated during pyrolysis which give the better
taste to RCB over RL.

Purpose

The purpose of this test was to determine whether there were subjective
differences with extended smoking of two ultraslim cigarettes: PM Trim 1
blend control, and the PM Trim 4 model with calcium carbonate, —42 perforated
paper, and CMC.

Methods

Sixty flavor—low smokers from the 0C Walk—in Panel participated in this test.
Each panelist was given one pack of the test cigarette and one pack of the
control, and asked to smoke all cigarettes provided. They were then asked to
evaluate the first and last cigarette from each pack on the attributes of
mouth and throat impact, aftertaste, unusual flavor, mouthcoating, tobacco
taste, and acceptability. Presentation order was balanced and analysis of
variance was used to analyze the data.

To further support price promotion, whenever possible, a price call out space will be included
on B headers to communicate pricing.

Effective immediately the types of POS detailed above are to be used exclusively for
Marlboro Price Off Promotions.

antingous POS for all Brands

In an effort to upgrade all continuous brand POS, senior sales management will be
requested to identify ongoing requirements for at least four brands, excluding Marlboro.
Select POS items will then be produced and made available to the field. Details regarding
these items will be communicated under separate cover.

i I m 'x
As you know, optimal placement of POS and fixturing is essential to maximize the return on
our investment. As a result, ideal store layouts which illustrate the preferred placement of PM
USA POS and fixturing will be developed for each trade class. This information should be
used as a guide to achieve the desired PM USA look in each account.

Your support of this philosophy is imperative if we are to achieve a strong presence for our
brands. Together we can ensure that our brands are advertised in a manner that is
consistent with our long—term goals.

EE_F: News Article
_________________———————-——

FYI, follows attached an article published today at “0 Estado de sac Paulo” about the
action moved against Souzs Cruz which ﬁrst articles I’ve sent you yesterday.

The attached article refers to important legal opinions, who believe Scum Cruz will win in
a second instance, considering that “111ng cigarettes is a legal activity.
Adversiting and warnings are regulated by law, which makes the cigarettes marmfaoturing
activity even more legitime.“ One of the lawyﬂs who has be- consulted (Dr. Celso
Bastos) also added that “this decision is clearly oriented by US inﬂuence”.

An other lawyer (Dr. Jorge Celidonio) questioned “how it could be possﬂzle to determine
ifthe smoker only consumed cigarettes from Souza Cruz, during his whole life”. and still
complemented by saying that “if the person started to smoke as a kid, also his parents
should be considered guilty”. Still this same lawyer added “that other habits can also

provoque heart attacks”.

Only one attorney believes that "if it could be proven that the smoker only consumed
cigarettes ﬁom Souza Cuz and that his death was really a. consequence of the smoking
habit, the cause & effect relation would then be a ﬂeet”. This same attorney considered, at
the other hand, ese proves difﬁcult to be obtained.

Industry Research Concept/Research Council Smoking & Health

The term of office of the 4th Research Council expires in 1990.
WPA discussed considerations on the re—formation and research
objectives of the future Research Council. There was unanimity
that the Research Council in its existing composition and
objectives is defined too narrowly for the current problems and
that therefore the remit of the next Research Council should be
formulated more widely and not only specifically tobacco industry
oriented. There was also unanimity on the fact that the existing
period of office of the Research Council of 3 years is too short.
There were adverse comments by WPA on the legal status of a
foundation, introduced into the discussion by Prof. A.

A working group dealing with the future Research Council and
consisting of Messrs Wille (PMG), Konig (VDC), Herter (BAT) and
Wieckmann (REE) came, at its first meeting, to the conclusion that
the person of Prof. Thurau is of particular importance in the
formation of the next Research Council.

Note

 

A paper about the 1990 Research Council, elaborated by U. Beecken
and VV. Fink for G. Wille, regards the elaboration (If the
scientific principle of the importance of endogenic exposure vs.
exogenic exposure of man as one of the main tasks of the new
Research Council. Collaboration of the industries concerned in a
"total industry" Research Council should be possible on this
basis.

sumecr‘ mam TQ FT, LEONARD woon FOR vxcaaoy PRICE TEST - .1

PURPOSE OF VISIT

Ft. Leonard Wood is a late addition to the VICEROY military price
test, with VPR offerings beginning July 18. Previously, Ft. Knox

refused to expand the style offerings with a $1. 50 VPR, so Leonard‘
Wood is being used as a replacement. f

 

_While it was intended that a $1.50 VPR be used at this commissary,'

H ;w a $1.00 off coupon has been offered in conjunction with the VPR.
, I. In order to monitor sales activities at the commissary and to"
» assess the appropriateness of continuing the test, Ft. Leonard

Wood was visited on Friday, July 29. The following observations

were made while visiting the Ft. Leonard Wood Commissary.

 

OBSERVATIONS

1. Sales - Approximately five cases of VKSF, two cases of ”m
VSL and one case of VRL 100's were sold on July 29 (a pay
day). This was accomplished with a 6—carton maximum per

person. Prior to the test, average VICEROY volume was 90
cartons per week, all of it in VKSF. The sales volume on

this Friday represented a 26- fold increase over average
re-promotion volume. Sales would have een substantlally
higher had not the supply of RICH LIGHTS 100's been depleted

_ by noon.lh

VICEROY was the lar est sellin brand at the commissary on
July 29, selI1ng more cartons than Mathoro or gener1cs.

Generic sales volume averaged 5—6 cases per day before the
test; since the promotion, generic sales have averaged 2-3

cases per day.

 

Source of Business - Based on informal observation, a majority
of purchasers appeared to be former generic smokers (many of

whom were former VICEROY smokers). Other major competitive -,.
sources of business were Winston, Marlboro or Pall Mall smokers.

3. Reasons For Not Purchasin - Those consumers who did not pur- ,
chase VICEROYs sa1d that they generally smoked low tar or .
menthol cigarettes, were loyal to their own brand (particularly
Marlboro, RALEIGH and Kent smokers), or were VICEROY trier- “‘ ”

rejectors.

Re: -- Ingredients Identiﬁed by HHS as Used in the

Manufacture of Cigarettes but not Approved

f r e i
1. Ammonia —- Ammonia is used as a processing aid in the production of cigarettes.
Greater than 95 percent of the ammonia is recovered for reuse. Only trace levels remain
in the ﬁnished cigarette. Due to its low boiling point, residual ammonia does not pyrolyze.
Ammonia is a natural constiment of tobacco. Several ammonia-containing compounds are
listed as generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by FDA for use in food, including ammonia
hydroxide, mono and dibasic ammonium phosphate, ammonium sulfate. ammonium
biocarbonate, ammonium carbonate and ammonium chloride (21 CPR. §§ 184.1135,
184.1137, 184.1138, 184.1139, 184.1141, 184.1143). Ammonia compounds are approved
for use in tobacco by the Independent Scientiﬁc Committee on Smoking and Health (the
Hunter Committee) in the United Kingdom. ‘ Ammonia is a naturally occurring substance
that is produced endogenously by humans at levels far in excess of that delivered in the
smoke of a cigarette. Environmental regulatory and reporting requirements applicable to
the use, disposal and transportation of signiﬁcant quantities of ammonia have no bearing on
the appropriateness of its use in cigarette manufacture. The Occupational Safety and Health

Administration (OSHA) workplace exposure limit for ammonia greatly exceeds any levels

to which smokers would be exposed.

Mr. Hetsko of American spoke to me Monday, August 3. He
advised that the company had taken a position with respect to the

Kolodny — Beatty luncheon matter.

I told him I did not know what he was talking about.

He explained Mr. Rolodny had asked for a luncheon meet-
ing which was attended by:

Messrs. Bantle of U. 8. Tobacco
Bowling of Philip Morris

Judge of Lorillard

MeAllister and Provost of
Liggett & Myers

Mooney of American and

Wade of Reynolds.

1

He stated that no Brown a Williamson representative was present.

He stated that he was calling all companies to tell them
that American’ 5 position was that they would go along with the pro-

posal subject to conditions as follows:

1. All of the other principal manufacturers
(six companies) agreed. 1

2. Everything was approved by the General
Counsel of each of the six companies.

I asked him how we, the General Counsel, would know what
'was being done. He said that he had no answer.

I iterated that I knew nothing of the matter. I further
stated that you and I would not be able to talk until this week.

I gathered that there is some proposal, in writing, which
was distributed at the luncheon.

SUBJECT: Revised Project Schedules

Mr. Judge recently directed us to alter the timing on three -
projects: (1) True 100's tar reduction, (2) KGL 100's .
tar reduction, and (3) Aspen. We have revised the project
schedules to accomodate his requests and the following

paragraphs will summarize the revised schedule and their

impact on the remaining projects.

I. TRUE lOO'S TAR REDUCTION

According to our prior schedule, this project would have
been completed by 1-1-79 except for Market Research
which was not scheduled. Mr. Judge has directed

that we be in market on 1-1-79. We have one can—

didate (same taste) ready and will select another
candidate (True 5 taste) for Market Research. The
revised schedule follows:

(1) Make MRD samples 9 October 1978
(2) 'Ship MRD samples 20 October 1978
(3) Samples arrive in N.Y. 23 October 1978
(4) TDp Line results 20 November 1978
(5) Test Mkt. Prod. Start 27 November 1978
(6) Test Market Sales 2 January 1979

In order to meet the schedule, we must have all approved
artwork in hand and order all materials (tipping, labels,
etc.) needed on 16 October 1978.

This project was originally budgeted at 2300 man-hours

(of which 1860 were budgeted in 1978) excluding Market

Research sample preparation, evaluation, and production
monitoring. The new schedule allows for 1375 man—hours
in total. '

Tore Dalhamn — “PMO” Patent Application
Foreign Filings

 

 

_ Professor Dalhamn's basic patent, dealing with oxadiaeole
additives to tobacco, has issued in the United States. Patents
corresponding to that patent have issued in Belgium, Canada,
France and Switzerland. Further applications for corresponding
patents are pending in Denmark, Great Britain, West Germany,
Italy, Holland and Sweden.

A second United States patent, of a related nature, is now
pending in the United States. A decision with respect to those
foreign countries in which corresponding applications should he
sought is now in order. Such filings must be completed no later
than October 30th; therefore, our immediate attention to this

matter is necessary.

I have reviewed this matter with Dr. Spears, and we are of
the joint conclusion that corresponding foreign applications
with respect to the latest U. 8. application should be sought in
all those foreign countries set forth above in which applications
have been sought to correspond to the basic issued U. S. Dalhamn

patent.

We assume that the aforesaid foreign countries include those
in which there is the greatest cigarette consumption, and to
which Lorillard now exports or will potentially e2port the great—
est numbers of cigarettes. If this is not the case, such addi-
tional countries as fall into those categories should be considered

for addition to the list. (X??2£ﬁ399

SUBJECT: PROMOTIONS — True Carton Cash Continuity Program

 

 

Please ﬁnd attached the latest topline review of the True Carton Cash Continuity Program from
October 1 1th through October 22“. Also ﬁnd included the response analysis chart.

The number of cartons produced for this offer was 1,745,000. The original response projection
for this program was 11% and would have resulted in 16,000 coupon requests, or the submission
of 192,000 cash pieces. Response to this program continues to be very good. As of October
22nd, we had received a total of 257,016 cash pieces from consumers, resulting in 21,418 free
carton coupon requests. The response rate currently stands at 14.7%. Actual results have
exceeded the original projection by a considerable amount.

Of the requests we received, 90% derived from the True ﬁlter packings and 10% from Menthol.
Also of note, 36% of the respondents smoke 20 to 29 cigarettes per day. 27% of the respondents
smoke over 40 cigarettes a day and 17% smoke from 30 to 39. 13% did not specify.

Also ﬁnd enclosed the True Carton Cash Projected Response chart. This chart shows the original
projection and the revised projection for this program and how they compare with the actual
response. You will see that the actual response through October 22'1d (21,418) has already
surpassed the October projection (21,215).

Upon your review of these reports, please contact me with any questions or if additional
information is required.

We have reviewed the_subject patent application and our comments
and questions are as follows:

1. Pages 6, 7, l0 and Claim #3 .........

Molecular weight range should be to 600,000 instead of
300,000 as NSRN 3000 is approximately 600,000.

2. Page 7, line 9 ..........
Change N-750 to N-3000.

3. Page 7 ...........

What does Patent #3,l54,5l4 (line 24) cover? Manufacture
of Tergitol by Carbide or is this use of Tergitol as a
plasticizer? Note licensing conversations by Howard Kothe

with Carbide regarding use of Tergitol in our formulation.
It is described in our examples. Any problem anticipated

here?

4. Page ll, beginning at line l4 ............

The description of a dilution measuring device is
irrelevant when describing the smoke machine. This section
needs revision.

Background

A Newport 10's pack program was placed in stores in the South
Bronx the week of 6/02 and in Detroit the week of 5/25. The 10's
packs were placed in temporary displays with p.o.s. support
including 2 wide, 4 wide cards, shelf talkers and small posters.

The perceived benefit to consumers was an out-of-pocket cost
advantage, thereby serving as a trial device for the Brand.

The South Bronx test area is a lower income area with a primarily
Spanish population. RJR audits indicate a 9% S.O.M. for Newport
box, second in share to Marlboro box. New York tax laws require
a tax stamp on the 10's which was affixed by the jobber at a cost
of $1.25 per thousand units. In this area 4 of the original 10
test stores were replaced due to excessive pilferage. This had
resulted in our displays being removed from the counter by store
owners.

‘ In Detroit, total Newport Green has a share of 4.60% (12 months
through 9/82). Logistically, this test was easier as taxes are
paid by the jobber off invoices. Fourteen stores were tracked in
the Detroit panel. After July 23rd however, data on only 5
stores was tracked due to stores dropping from the panel and 1
store closing. °

MEMORANDUM

TO: Patrick Donoho
V.P. Tobacco Institute

FROM: John Chwat

DATE: February 21, 1997

It was a pleasure talking with you about our mutual efforts to extend our clients
special interests thrOughout the United States. And, I appreciate the opportunity to tell
you abbot an exciting project we developed for the National Licensed Beverage
Association (NLBA). When we spoke, I mentioned that our ﬁrm has taken the lead, on
behalf of the NLBA, to establish new NLBA state afﬁliates and to build their

membership. The name of this project is Campaign 2000. Because of our contacts
within the hospitality industry, we have been very successful in our efforts to establish
new state afﬁliates. At the beginning of Campaign 2000 (July 1, 1995), the NLBA
represented 18 states. As of the ﬁrst of January ‘97, they represent 29 states. And, we
have 8 other states in various stages of the NLBA afﬁliation process. I’ll give you a run—
down for each state, later in this memo.

While we have added approximately 2,000 new members to the NLBA rolls, the
pace of our membership recruitment has been less than meteoric. As you can imagine,
the membership recruitment portion of Campaign 2000 is pick-and—shovel work that
requires peeple and funds. Typically, our new state afﬁliates have a small cadre of
people, but, understandably, no start-up funds. It’s a bit of a Catch-22 situation. Despite
my limited budget, I try to help where I can with brochures, literature and press releases.
Hewever, mailing lists, labels, postage, design work for state afﬁliate logo’s and
application forms, are often beyond the new state afﬁliates ﬁnancial capability.
Accordingly, they are only able to do a limited amount of membership recruitment.
While I expect the pace to Speed-up over the next several months, I remain concerned
that the organizing groups may not be in a position to fully exploit a recent development
that will make NLBA membership especially attractive to retailers who offer music (live
and mechanical), and/or television broadcasts.

OVERVIEW

Among the Marlboro Lights 100mm NMF smokers, no significant differences
were indicated on preference between the Marlboro Lights 100mm
cigarettes (52%), and Benson & Hedges Lights 100mm (48%).

Qualitatively, mrlboro was perceived to have a "milder taste" and to be
"less harsh". A large percentage of the Marlboro Lights smokers
preferred their own brand because it was milder.

Among the Benson & Hedges Lights 100mm NMF smokers, no significant
differences were indicated on preference between the Marlboro Lights
100mm cigarettes (50%) and Benson & Hedges Lights 100mm (50%).
Qualitatively, Benson & Hedges was perceived to be "more satisfying" and
to "have an easier draw". Marlboro was perceived to have a "milder
taste" and to be "less harsh".

The cross section of other flavor low 100mm NME‘ smokers significantly
preferred (at 90% confidence level) the Benson & Hedges Lights
cigarettes (56%) to Marlboro Lights 100mm (44%). Qualitatively, B&H was
perceived to be "more satisfying". Marlboro Lights was perceived to be

Ra APPROVAL RECOMMENDATION: CARLTON ASSAULT W-3 EXPANSION

 

The following proposal recommends funding an expansion of
the CARLTON Assault effort to Section W—3. Total estimated
costs are $1,920,000.

BACKGROUND

The CARLTON Assault is a fully integrated effort with all
the key elements (Advertising, Direct and Promotion)

focused to create maximum pressure against the retail
environment and competitive smokers. It is a swift and
powerful program designed to build business and capture new
share.

The Assault program is a strategic tool reserved for highly
developed growth opportunity areas —— success breeds

success. To achieve full impact, we continue to believe a
full year of activity is required. Thereafter, the Assault
strategy moves on to another strong area.

Section W—3 is our strongest CARLTON area with a 145 SDI
(2.29 share). W—3 represents 6.64% of population and, more
importantly, 9.61% of CARLTON sales.

W-3 is also scheduled to participate in the 1992 Future
Bold expansion which will provide added S/O support.

CONNECTICUT ASSAULT RESULTS

MSA, which covers the entire store universe, is showing a

positive CARLTON share trend. Due to shipment volatility,
we are examining three month moving shares.

FROM, Sandra Pecan ,47Q/

wuxm Summary of Leonard Zahn's Report on the American Heart
Association Annual Meeting, November 14-17, 1983

The American Heart Association held its annual meeting in
Anaheim, California, November 14-17, 1983. There was a record
turnout of physicians from around the country with more than
1,700 presentations. Press coverage was extensive, but the
smoking reports attracted little attention.

To further emphasize the smoking and heart disease issue, the
AHA had the Surgeon General's November 17 press conference.
piped into the press room. A statement was then issued by the
AHA on its reactions to the Surgeon General's report:

"Viewed over the long term, the cost in human
lives from continued smoking is staggering. As
many as 10% of all Americans now alive may die
prematurely of heart disease related to their
smoking behavior...this means 24 million premature
deaths due to smoking....The American Heart
Association pledges to continue unrelenting
efforts to make the American public more aware of
both the grievous dangers of smoking and the
health benefits that can quickly come from its
cessation...."

According to Leonard Zahn, reporters from the major media left
coverage of the Surgeon General's report to their Washington
bureaus and paid little attention to the AHA's statement.

Highlights of the meeting follow:
SMOKING AS A RISK FACTOR

Aaron Folsom, Minneapolis, reported on a study that assessed

the use and‘possible health risks of low-yield cigarettes (15mg pg
or less of tar). Levels of serum thiocyanate (a metabolic CD
product of hydrogen cyanide which is in the gas phase of the Pi
main stream of cigarette smoke) and cigarette brands smoked CH
were determined in 2,561 adult smokers who were among 9,106 52
persons participating in two heart disease risk factor surveys ‘1
in seven upper midwestern communities from 1980 to 1982. ‘1
p

Findings indicated that compared to 1980 data for the country
as a whole, a greater proportion of smokers in these

communities smoked low-yield brands. Low tar brands were more
popular with women than with men. There was no relationship

INTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE

Richmond, Virginia

To: Dr. C. L. Ellis \ Date: August 25, 1998
From: A. I. Goldsmith x\~

«
Subject: The Merit story

When Merit was launched in 1976, part of the promotional activities included a whirlwind tour by Dr.
Ikeda touting the scientiﬁc breakthrough that enabled the creation of a low delivery cigarette with a
full ﬂavor taste; other researchers also spoke to the press, including Bill Dunn, Walt Gannon, and Hel-
mut Wakeham. Based on the news reports —- some of which are enclosed —- I pieced together a possi-
ble sequence to account for a reference to nine years of research in light of the fact that the quest for
a ﬂavorful low tar cigarette goes back at least to 1958 [C58—00972; 1]. Actually, most news stories say

twelve years, which probably dates to the 1964 Surgeon General’s report. Interestingly, however,
C75-01560 lists HTI test codes for high burley blends similar to the Timer blend so as to be able to
substantiate claims that work had been continuing for seven years.

It would appear that Dr. Ikeda’s clock started ticking at about the time a research program began at
the Illinois Institute of Technology Research Institute (IITRI) of which Philip Morris was a sponsor.

Philip Morris ﬁrst got involved with llTRl in 1965 [C65-03108], when looking into electrostatic ﬁlters.l
Then in 1968, along with Airkem, Armour & Company. Gillette, Givaudan, Glidden-Durkee, S. C.
Johnson & Company, Lever Brothers, Procter & Gamble, Rexall Chemicals, and Vick Chemical, Phi-
lip Morris began jointly sponsoring a research program on odor characterization and measurement
headed by Andrew Dravnieks. Progress reports from IITRI [2-12] refer to olt‘actometers, and of course
gas chromatography was relied upon heavily. both of which correspond with the terminology in
Ikeda’s presentations. When the initial three year program concluded, Philip Morris signed on as a
co-sponsor of a two year follow—up program.

More signiﬁcantly, Philip Morris assisted in a study on the determination of odor components in
tobacco smoke, which was sponsored by the American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air Con-
ditioning Engineers (ASHRAE). Phase I [9 and 13] found GC peaks correlating with likely contributors
to tobacco odor, and Phase 11 used mass spectrometry to identify most of the constituents [11].
Although the commercial cigarettes used were Winston, Philip Morris provided 1R1 Reference
Cigarettes for use: some cigars and pipe tobaccos also were studied. In addition, PM R&D experts
assisted in the identiﬁcation of some ambiguous mass spectra. There was supposed to have been a
Phase III geared to creating a tobacco odor simulant for room ventilation studies by mixing the most
important constituents identiﬁed in Phase II, but I have not found a copy of a Phase III report.

The Phase II report is signiﬁcant, because later in 1974 one sees the ﬁrst indications in internal docu-
mentation of the identiﬁcation of odor-intense smoke constituents with the goal of using some to add
ﬂavor to a low delivery product [IR74-089 and C75—05631}. The major discontinuity in this sequence
is that IITRI’s compounds seem to relate more to room odor or even to stale odor than to the ﬂavorful
odor of fresh mainstream smoke. The urgency of Project Timer seems to have left little time for writ—
ten documentation other than in laboratory notebooks, so it is difﬁcult to determine how, when, and by

' Probably because the Surgeon General‘s Report discussed the charge on smoke particles.

MEMORANDUM

August 21, 1995

TO: K. Paitakis
FROM: A. Sadovnick

SUBJECT: PHONE CARD SUPPLIER

As discussed, Schneider Communications, our phone card supplier,
was acquired by Frontier Communications on August 8, 1995.
Frontier then merged with ALC on August 16, 1995. The new

company has a market value of $4. 3 billion, according to the
attached newsletter.

The implication of this merger relative to our promotions on
Kent, True, and Style is simply, that we are now dealing with a
much larger supplier. Geri Matzke has assured me there will be
no changes in pricing or any delay in implementing the program
due to this merger.

Frontier Communications is an original provider of telephone
time, as well as the fifth largest long distance carrier in the
U.S. (see attached letter).

Please issue the revised purchase order to Frontier.

A carton of each Sample and Control was submitted by Product

Development for gas phase analyses. All samples were conditioned
for 48 hours in the Smoking Lab conditioning room and weight
selected by the Smoking Lab prior to analysis.

Four cigarettes from each group were then selected and analyzed
using a Borgwaldt smoking machine coupled directly to a Varian
3600 GC. A Cambridge pad on the smoking machine removes the
particulate matter from the whole smoke passing only the gas phase
to the gas chromatograph. Puffs prior to the sample puff are
vented. The sample puff selected is taken on the next puff after
the burn line had passed a point 35mm from the tipping paper.

The gas phase column effluent is split into two detectors. The
NPD detector is most selective to organic compounds containing
nitrogen and the total area relates to the total concentration of
all these compounds detected in the gas phase. The other detector
is a FID which detects most organic compounds and the total FID

area relates to the total concentration of all these compounds.

BACKGROUND

Fully 17% of Benson & Hedges smokers are Black, an index of 213
to Total Industry Black usage, the deepest penetration of Black
smokers by any Philip Morris brand (source: 1988 Tracking Study).
In an effort to retain this strong user base, B&H has developed a
special'Inner—City program for implementation throughout 1990.

Benson & Hedges will deliver a 2-pack with hip bag promotion to
Inner City markets and all military bases in April 1990. The
program, in conjunction with Black media advertising, Black
couponing in Black magazines, and other targeted retail efforts,
make up the B&H 1990 Inner City program.

The LT CSC‘s from the replicate smokings (prepared as 10mg/mh stock sohu-
tions in DMSO) were tested randomly in strain TA98+59 according to the:standard

control data from this experiment were withinwnormalirahges.

Table 1 shows the‘ analysis of variance on the experimental results
(performed using "Minitab"). Statistically, there was no difference between the
control and the test sample. this resuit implies that adding this compound to
fitler at a lower level may not have a signiﬁicant effect on activity. However,
it should be notedvthat except for smoking 3, all of the S.ALs ﬁor the test
sample were higher than the:S.Ats of the control. The1resulting mean S.At for

results. The average CSC‘yieldVCigarette was the same for each cigarette type

Project Description: Potential tobacco ﬂavoring materials will be subjected to an extensive
review of the toxicology literature before they are approved for use. Based on this review, some
materials may be entered into a battery of toxicological screening tests which will be contracted
to commercial laboratories. The project requires extensive record keeping, external study
monitoring, documentation and report evaluation. Personnel from the Organic Chemistry,

Analytical Development, and Product Development groups will be utilized periodically to
provide specialized analyses. '

Project Accomplishments:

Inhalation

The protocol for a 13-week inhalation study with cigarette containing diammonium
phosphate has been developed. The production of test cigarettes originally scheduled for

mid-November was postponed until early December. The study should begin in early
January. '

A draft final report of the 13—week inhalation study with cigarettes containing different
levels of sugar was received. A summary of the study methods and results was prepared

This paperhas been reviewed in detail1 and1 I have the following.
comments to make:

In terms of scientiﬁc merit, this paper is not a significant: 1 " "“
contribution. However, it has be en presentedpreviously at '
CORESTA and, in our opinion, does not deal with any material
detrimental to our company’s business. lit does not do much to
improve the scientific image of‘our company. However, there;
is every reason to believe it is scientifically accurate.
\‘ .
As with many publications; the title promises more than is '
delivered in thepaper. The title leads one to expectto‘ learn
what the effects of the properties of carbon have on cigarette
smoke filtered through carbon. The major portion of the paper
deals with a‘ description of the properties of carbon with only
limited informationonw the: effect of charcoal: on cigarette smoke
(analysis of cysteine). In addition, it is not clear what specific .
type of charcoal was the: final subject of their study.

A major weak point relates to tables 1‘ and 2‘. The last entries
in these tables refer to the heat of absorption of the two: char-
coals studied. The figures reflect: results from two different
methods of measurement. The results differ significantly to
which only a passing reference: is made.

There should be an explanation or at least speculation as to why
these‘figures differ. I believe the authors in other work on‘heat
of absorption of charcoal have made direct colorimetric measure-
ments. Reference: could be made to this point and results from
such; studiesused to explain the differences in they tabulated
measurements. -

swam: New York City Task Force

 

There is widespread consensus that Mayor Koch's: antibemkj‘ng‘ proposal,

together with the clear bias that will emanate fran the califano‘ Cc‘nmittee, is

of serious national concern and has multiple negative implications fOr‘ our
cause.

We anticipate a lengthy, difficult, potentially acrinoniws campaign to‘ defeat
this anti-smoking measure.

In order to accarplish this, we are assembling a special New Yerk City‘Task
Force, which will work full time on this important effort fOr at least the
next SD days. The Task Force will be situated in the large ninth floor
conference man and will serve as the nerve center of the company's effOrt to‘
defeat the Mayor's anti-smoking efforts. The Task Force will consist of

professional and clerical personnel, drawn franw throughout the corporation for

tanporany duty. The Task Force will operate in liaison with the PM U.S.A.
Corporate Affairs Department to ensure a coordinated, correct approach.

We very mach need your assistance in forming this special Task Force. Because
most of the activities of the Task Fbrce center on coordination and logistics
between myriad disciplines and activities, we believe the Task Force Leader
should be an individual with such experience.

Jeannine Dcwlinq's name immediately comes to mind. Her successful experience
with two World Fairs: and‘ with her current duties indicate she is the best
choice.

Consequently, we would respectfully request that Ms. Bowling be temporarily
assigned to PM man. CorporateAffairs, for a period of 90‘ days, in order to
be the Task Force Leader of the New YOrk City Task Force. All salary and
expenses will be assumed by PM‘ U‘.S.A.‘ for the assignment period.
If you agree, we muld‘ like: to, have the Task Force leader in; place by April 2,

A letter from me, with supporting enclosures (see attached
sample) was delivered prior to publication of the report to
each member of Congress.

The staff recontacted reporters and news bureau chiefs, who
had undergone staff briefings earlier,‘to provide them in
person with copies of the "executive summary" of our
position on smoking and heart disease (copy attached).

Following the Brandt-Koop news conference last Thursday at
11, 22 news organizations sought TI response and were given
our brief statement (copy attached). (There were 31 other
media inquiries the same day about the "Great American
Smokeout" and our staff response to that is also attached).

Major media coverage was thorough but not flamboyant or
"front-page." The New York Times used a UPI story, in
section D. The washington Post ran its own story, on page
3. The wall Street Journal had a modest, inside story.
USA Today gave the report three paragraphs at the end of a
short story on the "Smokeout." 0n evening TV news
broadcasts Thursday, ABC covered the story in 100 seconds,
CBS 135 seconds, and NBC 110. All had TI's comments, and

_the Times, UPI, the Journal and CBS used them.

Looking back at the media stir created by the Wall Street Journal article, Thursday, August
13, 1992‘, I'think our Corporate Affairs Department did an excellent job with "damage
control" (please see enclosed summary of events from Karen Daragan and summary of Jim
Oates' conversation with Smart Elliott of the New York Times).

The issue has died down and to the best of our knowledge, very little awareness was
created associating the B&H Special Kings brand name with the story and the reporting got
fairer with time. -

However, the Wall Street Journal article was very unfortunate and "unfair".

Ironically, although we committed only $9,200 for two issues of Genre (total of two ads)
out of a total media budget of well over $35 mio (l), we had long discussions up the line
including myself and J ack Nelson concerning the wisdom of approving Leo Bumett’s
recommendation to make this media buy. But, we decided it wasthe right thing to do.

Two unforeseen circumstances played a role: The day before the Wall Street Journal
called, we had just granted an exclusive interview and story on the B&H Special Kings
launch to Stuart Elliott of the New York Times (he held back the story as a result of the
WSJ article and only ran it last week). Hence, we did not give the story to the WSJ, but
only responded to their questions. '

Secondly, either the actual publication or someone else, drew theWSJ attention to our
media buy. It is not the ﬁrst time that the WSJ marketing section prides themselves with
"tabloid reporting sensationalism". Why they chose this angle for the story is strange, as it
was well know that Absolut Vodka and Miller had advertised in this publiCation for some
time.

It continues to bechallenging to take measured risks when trying to create impact for the
advertising of our cigare .

Marlboro Lights Box

In addition to the two highly—developed Marlboro Lights markets
(Minneapolis and Phoenix) that we suggested as test areas for
Marlboro Lights Box, we would also recommend conducting the test
in a below average Marlboro Lights market. We have found that

a number of the weaker Marlboro Lights markets are also strong
box areas. As such, a box packing in these markets may compli-

ment the soft pack and improve the overall performance of the
Lights‘ packings.

We would suggest New Orleans as a test market for this purpose.

SUBJECT: Laboratory Test Results on Some Sample Cigarettes Used
in the Technical Study Group for the 1984 Cigarette
Safety Act

A series of 32 cigarettes were prepared for the Technical Study
Group as directed in the 1984 Cigarette Safety Act. Specifi-
cations of these cigarettes are given in the November 4, 1985
memorandum of Dr. A.W. Spears. The series of cigarettes were
evaluated for smoke deliveries and linear burn rates. These
results are given in Table 1 and 2 for the 21 mm and 25 mm
circumference cigarettes.

This series covers a linear burn rate range of 3.40 mm/min to
10.63 mm/min. The linear burn rates between the corresponding
21 mm and 25 mm samples were similar except for the expanded
flue-cured cigarettes (21 mm, 13—16) and (25 mm, 29—32). These
differences are illustrated in Figure 1.

In this study, paper porosity influences smoke deliveries more
than paper additives. A decrease in porosity from 75 to 10
CORESTA resulted in a 20 to 40 percent increase in nicotine, CPM
and CO deliveries. The addition of citrate caused a modest
increase in C0 and a 5.to 15 percent reduction in CPM and nicotine.

Burn rate studies were conducted between FNLN—Zl, the slowest
burning cigarette, and BNLC—Zl whose linear burn rate of 5.79
mm/min is more consistent with commercial cigarettes. This study
shows very little difference between FNLN—21 and BNLC—Zl on a
select group of fabrics. The results shown in Table III include

a previous study involving a set of four cigarettes on 33 different
fabrics.

To: Melissa Jeltema Date: May 19, 1994
From: ' Kimberly Singh Nb ’
Subject: Project Case Compilation of "Filter Material" Responses

The panel was composed of ten employees, ﬁve females and ﬁve males. Three of the
women were given the paper ﬁlter, while two received plastic ﬁlters. The reverse was
given to the men. The test took place on Thursday, May 12 and on Friday, May 13.
We did not originally plan for two days but due to "technical difﬁculties", the ﬁlters for
the superslim cigarettes were not ready until Friday. Therefore, those smokers
participated on that day, while all the other smokers performed the test on Thursday.
One ﬁlter was given to each person and they were instructed to use this ﬁlter for the

day and if for some reason they needed another one, they could receive a new one.

The responses that we received from the one-on—one interviews have been compiled
below.

The overwhelming response for the open-ended question of "conunents/problems/issues"
was the functionality of the ﬁlter. With the exception of one person, all respondents
experienced difﬁculty in ﬁtting the ﬁlter on the cigarette. Other comments were: the
RTD was decreased; the ﬁlter made the cigarette too strong; the idea of putting a ﬁlter on
each cigarette before smoking is a "pain"; the ﬁlter made it difﬁcult to light the cigarette;
and, the ﬁlter made the circumference of the cigarette larger than what is accustomed to

being felt while smoking.

As far as the "preferred" material, four participants out of the ﬁve that used the plastic
ﬁlter would prefer that type of material verses the paper. The female that did not choose
the plastic did not like the "slick" feel of the material. Another reason was that the
cigarette could possibly slip out of the mouth if not being held tightly with your lips. The
others said the feel of the plastic was pleasing. They also liked the sturdiness or ﬁrmness
of the plastic, and the lip release was good. This question was only asked to the plastic

ﬁlter users.

The paper ﬁlter users did not mention any particular thing that they liked about it, but
also did not mention any dislikes, with the exception of one person that said the ﬁlter

became "grubby" by handling it so much.

Each person used the original ﬁlter given to them for the entire day, with the
exception of one paper user. The amount of cigarettes smoked during the day, for
each participant, ranged from 5 to 40. The person that requested a new ﬁlter used
the ﬁrst one for 8 cigarettes and the second paper ﬁlter was used for 11 cigarettes.

FROM: R. E. Grizzel REG

SUBJECT: TLA MONTHLY SUMMARY - MAY, 1990

The following is an outline of our activities during May, l990.

I. Samples submitted for analysis
TLA — 57 samples were’processed through the Primary.
Routine Chemical
International — 75 samples
Oriental Leaf — .47 samples
Export Blend - 40 samples
Off-Shore - 7 2 samples
Stemmery — 1 sample
Speculative - 1 sample

166 total samples
II. Results Reported
Results on 163 routine chemical analysis samples were reported.
III. Instrumentation/Equipment
Our x—ray machine malfunctioned on May 10, 1990. We were
unable to perform energy calibration. After talking with
Tracor personnel on the phone, they shipped us a power supply
board and an options board. Our maintenance personnel replaced
the power supply board and a Tracor service representative
stepped us through the process of adjusting the pots on the
options board. We were then able to adjust the gain and zero
to bring the instrument back on line.
The cutter drum was removed on May 24, 1990 and taken to Jewett
Machine. They placed the drum on their coordinate measuring
machine and will provide us with a scaled drawing of it.
Hopefully this drawing will give us some insight into why we
have had so much difficulty obtaining the desired cuts per
inch.

RE: LORILLARD IllARKET OVERWEWS - SEPT EJMBER, 1996

BASED ONJllSA SHIPAIEN T DA TA

Attached is a copy of the Lorillard Market Overviews for 12-months ending September, 1996
which are based on MSA shipment data.

Breakouts included in this report are as follows:

Markets - each Lorillard Area, Region and Division as well as Total US.
Items - Industry, key segments, and companies by brand

Data reported for all items in each market
- % of US. volume
- share of market
- share point change vs. year ago
- share development indices (SDI's) versus U.S. levels

Following is a brief summary ofﬁxll price versus discount trends by key brands and Areas.

W

Full Price share continues to grow in all Areas with increases ranging from +1.42 points or +2%
in the segment's strongest Northeast Area (78.33 SOM) to +2.60 points or +4% in the Southwest
Area where its share is lowest (65.10).

In total, the top six Full Price brands--Mar1boro, Newport, Winston, Camel, Salem, and K001 --
account for 77% of the category‘s sales. Of the six, Marlboro (31.93 SOM) is, by far, the most
important and is showing the greatest absolute share growth in all Areas with gains ranging from
+1.58 point in the Northeast to +2.9l points in the Southwest.

Subject: Videotapes oi Burns 0! Law Sid-stren- cigarettes

Samples of three sets of cigarettes obtained from Gordon Bokelman have
been videotaped at a magnification intermediate to those which were used in
the previous videotape. The cigarettes used were:

D9DA’1‘ Dual-wrapped with 45 g/M’ outer paper having 35% CaCO,,
(#9569) 0.4% NH.H,PO., 0.3% NaCMC, and 5% Kzsuccinate, and inner
paper with 18 g/M‘ basis weight, 3% Caco; and

0.6% citrate

DSDAV Single wrapped with high basis weight paper, 65 g/M‘,
(#9571) with 35% Caco, and 10% mum.

Marlboro Lights 100's as control

For all three cigarette sample sets, the burning event took place as we
had seen before, with a period of char followed by a burn. The burn seemed to
move around the circumference of the cigarette in‘ one direction or the other,
sometimes changing direction while on the visible side. Visual observation
of two cigarettes, placed in the chamber so that both sides could be seen,
showed the burn‘ proceeding on one side and then the other alternately in the
same direction. This suggested that the burn did, indeed, circle around the
full circumference in whichever direction it was moving.

The smoke from the Marlboro cigarette was visible in close proximity to
the rod, and on the images from these tapes the smoke was seen moving upward
along the front side of the rod, a few millimeters ahead of the char li‘ne
(Figure l) . All of the cigarettes in the test showed an area where smoke
emanates ﬂrom the underside of the rod a few millimeters ahead of the char
(Figures 1 to 4), but the video image of the low sidestream cigarettes did
not always include a plume above the rod (Figure 2) . During the taping, a
plume of smoke could always be seen‘ above these cigarettes by visual
inspection. Where the video image shows no plume, the smoke had coalesced to
form the plume at a point above and outside of the imaging area of the
camera. The visible smoke from the low sidestream cigarettes was
considerably less than that produced by the Marlboro cigarettes.

The cigarettes with the single wrapper of heavy-weight paper showed
bursts of smoke coming from the rows of perforations along the unburnt
portion of the rod, with sometimes startling visual displays (Figures 3 a 4) .
Depending on the orientation of the holes with respect to the camera, there
was a series of small plumes sometimes from the underside, sometimes from the
top, and occasionally they were visible on the front surface of the rod.

RICHMOND, VIRGINIA

Mrs. Thelma C. Heatwole V Dam; December 23, 1968

G. E. Inskeep
Remarks on Office Action on Helf. 582-518, PM #472

The bentonite in the present specification is not described
as ”calcined" and is not intended to be, but is the naturally
occurring finely divided or substantially colloidal form.

Kauffman specifies and claims repeatedly calcined bentonite
as the carrier for medicaments or vaporizable smoke-treating
agents, and describes the calcined bentonite as having ”few, if
any, of the distinguishing characteristics by which bentonites
are commonly identified and that it is a substantially different
substance from the starting or non-calcined bentonite.” (p. 3,
col. 2, l. 44). The calcined product is said to be no longer
colloidal. The agglomeration which is responsible for this means

that the product would not have the characteristics itemized on
p. 7, l. 12, of the present specification, since there would be

considerable pores and fissures and the particles could absorb
nicotine (at least in the sense of taking the liquid into the
pores). The molded form of Kauffman would be even less applicable.

The calcined bentonite is said to be a selective adsorbent
for nicotine. This would make it unsuitable for choice as a
carrier intended to release nicotine to the smoke; that is, it
could hardly be characterized as a ”weak adsorbent," by the
definition of our specification. As was remarked in regard to
the first Office Action, our requirement for weak adsorbents for
nicotine rules out those, as in Irby, et al., and Kauffman,
having a strong affinity for'it. Because they do not teach the
use'of weak adsorbents, those references do not, even when
taken with Bavley, et al., make obvious the present invention.

It is admittedly unfortunate that one or two of our weak
adsorbents (silica gel, zeolite) have the same name as adsorbents

RESOURCES HEARJNG, “TOBACCO SETTLEMENT V"

 

Committee Chair Jim leﬁ‘ords (R-VT.) began today’s hearing by announcing it would
be this committee‘s ﬁnal one. He also said that a week ﬁ'om tomorrow, the committee would hold
a mark—up on S. 1648‘, Jeffords tobacco bill. With that, Jeffords said that the subject of ETS is
addressed in his hill and would be the topic for the ﬁrst panel, witness Assistant Secretary for
Occupational Safety and Health Charles N. Jeffress. FolloWing the testimony of chﬁ’ess, were two
panels that discussed FDA authority. The fourth panel discussed possible compensation models for
3;; administering funds obtained in any tobacco resolution to individuals alleged to have smoking-
- related illness. Copies of testimony submitted in writing by the witnesses are attached.

Jeﬂ‘ress related the history ofOSHA’s proposed nilemaldng on indoor air and ETS,
noting that ET S contains 4,000 chemicals and compounds, 43 known human carcinogens and that

exposure to ETS is associated with asthma. cancer, lung cancer and heart disease. He urged
Congress to do two things:

-Declare a Congressional ﬁnding that ETS causes health effects; and

-Pass legislation on ETS that does not preempt stronger laws.

Ieffress said that if Congress would pass legislation containing ETS provisions then
OSHA would not have to issue a ﬁnal rule, instead the agency would only have to deal with
enforcement issues, which could be put into place in a “matter of months.” OSHA would prefer
legislation, according to chﬁ'ess. because the rulemaldng process can take four years or longer (“[a
major rule can take twice as long if the usual process is followed]") and then faces protracted

SUBJECT Menthol And jrjacetjn ass Eran] Arctic igbts Ei tencﬁnd ‘

_S_LMMARY

 

Louisville Branch Testing Department has conducted four separate
tests to determine the rates of menthol and triacerin loss from
Arctic Lights filter rods under various storage conditions.
Analyses have been conducted by both R&D and Branch Technical
Services. The results of these teSts indicate no significant '
loss of menthol or triacetin regardless of storage conditions.

A recommendation is presented that Arctic Lights filter rods he
handled and stored using normal procedures with no special pro-
tective measures being taken to control menthol loss.

LNTRDDUCTION

During the early development work for Arctic Lights it was rec- u
ognized that some special precautions might be required to prevent
loss of menthol from filter rods. Dz. Heitkamp obtalned samples
from two trays of filter rods over a 5 day period and reported

a substantial loss of menthol (Dr. N. D. Heitkamn to D v. Cantrell,
April 17,1978). Dr.Heitkamp'srcport indicated only a very
slight loss of triacetin. . ,

Two possible methods were devised for preventing menthol loss
from Arctic Lights filter rods. The first was a specially con-
structed filter rod tray which was totally enclosed on the top
and all four sides. The bottom fit flush with the shelf of a
tray trolley to form a nearly air tight container The second
method was a sealed tray trolley with plywood sides, top and
bottom Doors were fitted to the trolley wiLh metal frames
23nd felt gaskets.

 

A series of tests was designed to evaluate the various methods
of holding Arctic Lights filter rods.

RE: New York Cit Sam lin Ordinance and Ne ort Pro osal
\/

 

Newport proposes a distribution of cigarette samples
within New York City at an "attractive price above cost." I have
looked at Local Law 27 of 1990 of the City of New York to
determine the answer to the following question: whether the
general prohibition contained therein against distributing free

samples of tobacco products would extend to distributions at an
"attractive price above cost?"

Local Law 27 of 1990 provides the following:

"Distribution of tobacco products to the general public
at less than basic cost prohibited in public places and

at public events. No person shall distribute a tobacco
product for commercial purposes at less than the basic
cost of such product to members of the general public

in public places or at public events."

AdminiStrative Code of the City of New York § l7—l76(b).

There are some exceptions to the prohibition which are
not of immediate concern here and which have been addressed
elsewhere. I will concentrate, therefore, on the cost issue.

The code defines "less than basic cost" as meaning
". . . free of charge, a nominal or discount price, or
any other price less than the distributor’s cost, to
which shall be added the full value of any stamps or
taxes which may be required by law . . ."

Ibid, at §l7-l76(a)(2).

The woman circled, Faye Vernon, has indicated on the most recent Smokers Caucus survey that she would be
interested in starting a smokers' rights group

Virginia Slims Ultra Lights

This report updates Virginia Slims Ultra Lights most recent performance
in the Memphis and San Francisco test markets. Several data sources
will be referenced in order to provide a thorough analysis: Factory
Shipments, ICC, Retail Audits, and SPACE. Factory shipments were
initiated 1/22/87 with availability at retail effective 2/27/87.

Memphis

Shipment data reflect that Virginia Slims Ultra Lights registered a 0.6
S.0.M. based on recent four week period ending 5/15/87. Share was
virtually evenly distributed with Virginia Slims Ultra Lights Regular
displaying a 0.27 share and Virginia Slims Ultra Lights Menthol
contributing 0.31 share points.

At the distributor level, the brand's 4 week rolling averages have
continually grown, currently residing at a 0.8 level (w/e 4/24) --
equivalent to shipment data at that point in time.

Retail data, reflecting a 50 store panel located in the Memphis trading
area, are positioned at the 1.5 level based on the recent four week
period ending 4/26. The Ultra Light Regular and Menthol levels were
basically equal exhibiting a respective 0.7 and 0.8 S.0.M. The Ultra
Low Tar line extension currently attains a similar share in pack outlets
(S.0.M: 1.6) compared to performance in carton outlets (S.0.M: 1.4)
based on the current four week period. While the retail share data in
this report appear to be overstated in the two test markets, these
levels are at parity with share of smoker data reported by Consumer
Research, derived from a survey during week 10 after introduction.

In the audit panel, Virginia Slims Ultra had a distribution level of
83% for the two week period ending 4/13 -- down -7 versus the prior two
weeks. 0f the 83% carrying, 5% reported being completely 00S of the
brand. During the next two weeks, distribution increased to the 86%

level and none of the stores reported 005.

SPACE continues to report an availability of 85% as of w/e 5/08/87 -- at
parity with the audit panel.

To: The Members of the Executive Committee

From: Samuel D. Chilcote, Jr. 232:2):

Today, by a vote of 8—7, the Los'Angeles City Council rejected a
smoking ban in restaurants in favor of a more reasonable smoking
restriction measure. The phased—in ordinance proposal would
require 60 percent of restaurant seating space be set aside for
nonsmokers for two years. Then, the nonsmoker seating would be
increased to 70 percent. Signs stating, "smoking is permitted in
this establishment" must be posted on restaurant exteriors;

 

This measure now goes to the City Attorney for redrafting. The
new draft will be returned to the City Council for a final vote,
probably within the next 60 days. The mayor must then sign the

measure into law. We have no indication that he will not sign
this ordinance.

While we are not yet completely out of the woods in L.A., I know
you join me in congratulating everyone who has been involved in
this effort. As you know, we have pulled out all the stops to
prevent a ban. I am very pleased by the outstanding teamwork
that has taken place. The effort to date has been extensive,
complex and complete. That complete industry effort will
continue in the same vein throughout the process.

mar: FDA Regulation of Tobacco Products

Today President Clinton announced that the US. Food and Drug
Administration has issued regulations governing tobacco products, with the
stated purpose of reducing underage tobacco use. As you know, we firmly
believe that kids shouldn't smoke, and we're leading the industry in
preventing underage access to cigarettes.

On May 15, we proposed federal legislation that would make it
impossible for anyone to legally obtain tobacco products in the U.S. without a
face-to-face transaction where age can be veriﬁed. We believe a legislative
approach, which President Clinton has said he would prefer, would take us a
long way toward the goal we all share: a marketplace where kids cannot buy
cigarettes. We hope Congress will take up this issue soon.

The FDA's plan is wrong-headed. It's illegal. And we're going to ﬁght
it with everything we've got. The agency claims it must seize control over
cigarette advertising, promotion and sales to prevent underage smoking. And
FDA Commissioner Kessler says that once his agency takes control of the
tobacco industry, it could ban cigarettes.

This Pandora's box of regulation ﬂies in the face of the law, the facts,
history, common sense and public opinion. In our comer we have the U. S.
Constitution, recent decisions by the Supreme Court, Congressional history
and past statements by FDA commissioners. What's more, the vast majority
of Americans take our side on the central issues, including the right of adults
to make their own choices about whether to smoke and our right to market

our products to adults.

Our blueprint for legislation contains many of the same elements the
FDA has proposed. But under our plan, the FDA will be expressly forbidden

The attached is the ﬁnal report for the Cambridge Advertising Development Mini-Groups
that were conducted in Phoenix, Arizona on January 11th, 12th and 13th. Fifteen mini-
groups were conducted among men and women, ages 25-49 who regularly smoke:
Cambridge/C-Store Private Labels/Distributor Brands or National Deep Discount Brands.
The objectives of this research were to examine opportunities for Cambridge advertising
that would attract interest from the C-Store/Wholesale Competitive Discount Brands'
smokers and also would provide reinforcement to current Cambridge smokers.

It is important to note that research was conducted on the advertising prior to Phoenix: 33
in-depth interviews were conducted on December 14th and 15th in Minneapolis/St. Paul,
Minnesota among men and women, ages 25-54 who regularly smoke: Cambridge/Private
Label/Deep Discount. The objectives of this research were to determine the relevance of
two proposed campaigns ("Side by Side Comparison" & "Testimonial") to Cambridge and
B&W/PL smokers, and determine any negatives associated with either of the campaigns or
their speciﬁc executions. '

We;

The ﬁndings of both rounds of research were consistent. The overall ﬁnding being that
the comparison of Cambridge to Store Brands does not appear to be a relevant nor
compelling message to these smokers.

mo-kr

   

For the most part. these smokers appear to be content with what they are smoking. As a
result, the ads and concepts shown didn' t provide a motive to switch. The Cambridge
name did not provide an added advantage, warranting a higher price.

The term "Store Brand" does not appear to be relevant to consumers. The .
propositions/benefits conveyed in the concept statements/advertising were determmed to be
insigniﬁcant/not pertinent to these smokers.

For those not negatively predisposed to Cambridge’s taste, some of the claims about,
Cambridge would convert them to a purchase only if it was comparably priced to their
current low-priced brand.

WM

Cambridge smokers do not appreciate the frame of reference to low-priced brands, they see
their brand as being comparable to FM brands in terms of quality but they just pay less for
theirs.

It has not been necessary to make intting knife adjustments to keep the print

There are areas where some improvement can be made to the Minrint master
roIIs:

I. Each master roTI shoqu have a unique identification number.

2. The roIIs should be stacked with cores vertical, rather than
cores horizontai, on the pahhets.

3. The trim from each edge of the master roTI broke several times

SUBJECT: Style Special POS Pricing - Texas Test Market

The following is a list of cost estimates for the Vinyl Decal and 3 piece Mobile which we are

considering for the Texas test market. I have also received projected quantities from Sales
Planning as listed below.

The costs are as follows:

Item Quantity Cost Per Unit Total Cost
10 1/ 2" Vinyl Decal 6,600 $7.25 $47,850
3 Piece Mobile 6,000 $5.38 $32,280

The cost per unit listed above is based on a quantity of 2,500. Therefore, the actual cost per
unit will probably be slightly lower.

As you are aware, mechanicals for the decal, mobile and dummy pack are currently being
developed by Bob DeBlasio. Receipt of the decal and mobile mechanicals are expected by
July, 24, 1995.

Please feel free to give me a call if you have any questions!

The tabular format was chosen since it is a convenient method of answering the speciﬁc question of
where else U.S. companies conduct research. It must be pointed out that the methods Dun 8: Brad-

Regulation of Cigarettes by the Food and Drug Administration

 

 

You may remember that ianay 1977 ASH petitioned
the Food and Drug Administration to regulate cigarettes
as drugs under the Federal Ebod, Drug and Cosmetic Act.
The FDA deniedlthe petition‘andlits decision was upheld
by the ULS. District Court for the District of Columbia in

1979.

ASH appealed that decision to the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The attached
memorandnm to‘the‘COmmittee of Counsel from Covington &
Burﬂing describes the oral arguments before the Court of

Appeals on May 13.

Two related actions by ASH are pending, One seeks
to have the FDA regulate cigarettes as medical devices
because they dispense nicotine andithe other asks the FDA‘
to find that cigarette filters are medical devices. The

attached articte from the May 19 issue of the Legal Times of

washington describes all three of the pending cases.

The progress of these cases is being closely
monitored by the Committee of Counsel through Covington &

Burling.

T0: V. D. Lindsley V/
FROM: E. F. DeLaura
RE: -A -7 K T

Attached are some key findings from Harley's initial test market
performance in Terre Haute, Indiana.

K R U D

Harley-Davidson cigarettes were introduced in test market in
early September of this year. The brand was moderately sampled
and supported by newspaper and F81 inserts during its first few

months.

DESIGN

A 12-week AAU was conducted in mid-November among non-menthol,
Lo-Fi/Low Tar smokers which were further defined by the following

specifications:

BusmLﬁuma
. Males, 18—49 yrs., less than 2 yrs. of college

Eii' . J E ]_E

. Males 50 yrs. and older

. Males 18-49 better educated

. Females 18-49 yrs., less than 2 yrs. of
college

MBQ_EQEE

Please note that prior to the AAU, Lorillard's Telemarketing
Program was conducting its screening for its two carton free-
offer in Terre Haute. Although no product (Harley) had been
dropped, the incentive post card for the free cartons was mailed
to those who had been screened. There is the likelihood that
some of the respondents in the AAU received the Harley carton
offer prior to the AAU interviewing. Thus. awareness levels may
have been affected by this mail-in offer; no estimate can be

made.

Subject: .Structural and Elementai Characterization‘of Five Experimentai
Cigarettes.

Five experimental cigarettes were submitted for examination by scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) andlenergy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS).
The cigarettes were labelled‘as follows (Appendix I):

Virginia‘Superslims

ABE-1 35% Mg (on) 2

X8D9 ABC CaCO3 with liner
ABN 35% Mg(OH‘)z with‘Borax
AB? 15% Mg(OH‘)2 with liner

The ash, char-line, unburned paper and liner of the samples were
processed for analysis. Examinations and comparisons were made on the
structural features and on‘the elemental compositionlof the above sampies.

Virginia‘Superslims

The gross morphology of the ash appeared to be uniform in composition
and texture (Fig. 1). It contained dense aggregates of equant-shaped
particles which measured 0.4mm - ium in diameter. The surface of the
particles, as shown under high magnification, were either smooth or rough
(Fig. 2). The particles with a rough surface may be further broken down
into finer unit particles. The unburned paper contained high amounts of Cat
containing particles (Figs. 3, 4).. These particies appeared to have
metamorphosed dramatically through the burn since similar structures were
not visible in the ash. Similar results were obtained from the study done
on the K succinate Gacetate) containing papers by Gia Kim YiL. The char—
line on both sides of the paper containedlbubbles and crusty structures as
shown in Figsr 5 and 6. These structures were abundant at the char-line,
and were similar to ones found in‘the K—containing papers discussed‘by Gia
Kim‘Yil. There may be a heat—sensitive coating material present which
expands and bubbles as heat causes the release of gases; The crusty
structures may form as the bubbles cool.

The liner contained oblong-shaped particles‘which measured Oveum -
0.8mm in length (Figt 7). These Ca-containing‘particies appeared to be
different from the equant-shaped Ca particleslfound‘in the paper (Fig. 4).
The liner contained a low number of particles compared to the paper, and had
a smooth‘appearing surface. Major element31detected by EDS were Ca and K
from the ash and‘paper (Pig. 8), and Ca‘ﬁrom the liner.

DETA ILED FINDINGS

BA CKGROUND/METHODOLOGY

The primary objective of this research was to further learn about Generation Xers.
To achieve this objective, two focus groups were held among 18-24 year old
Miles and females in Englewood,NJ. on June 3, 1994.

Respondents were asked to discuss a number of issues, including:

- What they think Generation X is all about

- Factors that unite and/or inﬂuence their generation

- Similarities and differences between their generation and their parent's
generation

- Segments into which their generation can be divided and how those segments
can be identiﬁed :

Towards the end of the groups,respondents were shown a number of print ads
and were asked to sort theminto piles depicting different segments of the
population. They were then questioned about why the ads were for these
speciﬁc groups,with a special focus on ads that they felt were for them.

SUB/[MARY OF FlNDl¥§

These young adults view their generation as diverse,having varied interests and
lifestyles. Differences between people are expected and accepted. These?
differences enable Generation Xers to have friends who are interested a variety of
things and lead lives that are not the same as their own.

Despite the diversity found among these young adults, Generation Xers do
appear to share certain attitudinal and behavioral characteristics. Speciﬁcally,
these shared characteristics are that they:

- Resist segmentation and labeling

- Are self-focused

- Have mistrust for the news media

— Show marketing savvy

- Like to try new things and experience life

- Believe ﬁnancial security is important but is not their ultimate goal

Respondents in both groups had heard of the term "Generation X", with some
indicating that the termhad negative connotations. Speciﬁcally,one young
woman stated that Generation Xers "...supposedly don't care about anything."

sumecr: Conference Follow-Up

As I mentioned at the Corporate Affairs World Conference, I want to
follow-up with all participants on a number of issues.

First of all, I would like to thank everyone for attending and to
convey a special thanks to those of you who participated in
presentations or panel discussions or led the issues groups. I believe
everyone who attended felt challenged and I trust a good time was
had by all.

However, we know there is always room for improvement for the
next conference, and I suggested two ways in my closing remarks - a
stronger international focus and a site outside North America. But I
want to hear more from each of you. To that end, I have attached a
questionnaire for your comments. Please give us your frank and
honest opinion and return it to Hector Irastorza in the Washington,
DC. office by January 15, 1996. It will be important when planning
future conferences.

Also, as promised, attached are the final reports of each of the issues
discussion groups and Jim Lindheim‘s summary of "key learnings"
from the three panel presentations. I hope you will find them of
interest. Please share them with your colleagues in your
departments, especially those who were unable to attend the
conference. If you have any comments on any particular issue,
please let me know.

For those of you who are interested in receiving copies of any of the
internal presentations, please contact Peter Mirabella in the New
York Ofﬁce and he will make every effort to comply with your
request. However, please be aware that although our executives
were most pleased to be with us, they are somewhat reluctant to
distribute copies of their speeches because of the confidentiality and
sensitivity of some of the information in their presentations. Where
that is the case, we are looking to see if edited versions could be

made available.

Gnoup. Extra handsheets oil 10% CaCO paper were requested today, as there is some question
. . . . 3 .
about the acceptability of TiO2 in overwraps. Both paper types had better opacrty‘ than the

innerwnap-type paper now being used.

Severall samples of coatedlmat perforated to different: porosities at K-C were
received; K-C’s hole pattern is more widely spaced than the pattern used in the present
cartridges. Controllcamridges without perforated mat, cartridges with the lab perforated
mat, and cartridges from the four levels of K-C perforated mat are being prepared for
machine smoking TPM delivery.

A second set of samples has been machine smokedl to compare effects of lab
perforation vs no mat perforation, laminated vs unlaminated calendered overwrap, and
calend‘ered vs uncalenderedllaminated overwrap (P9TS innerwrap). TPMl was greater with
perforated mat. There was only a marginal difference between laminated and unlaminated
calenderedlpapers. For this particular paper, calendering also improved delivery slightly.
Calendering would have less of an effect: with lower porosity overwraps. These data support
the need for mat perforation, the degree of perforation neededl should be better known; after
smoking the K-C set of perforated samples.

II. Heater Development

Heater ﬁxtures with a center needle and ﬁxtures with a force-fit seal in place of
thee—ring seal are being evaluated. The details of this, work are included in Mike Watkin’s
weekly summary.

III. Kimberly-Clark

A production run to produce base mat was made in the KC mill located in Ancram,NY
(Nov 30/Dec l). The purpose of this run was two fold: l) to produce mat: using commercial
equipment and 2) pnoduce sufficient mat for machine start up through Phase II testing. EVen
thoughiKC eliminated many of the problem areas in the production line prior to the run

Strategy letter: Maverick 3rd Quarter 1999 Workplan Materials
Program #: 99—003M

Ob'ective: Provide tar eted im actful oint-of-sale materials that su ort

Maverick’s 1999 creative campaign.

 

Maverick’s “Real Deal” creative campaign will continue for 3rd Quarter workplan
materials.

Overall Strategy: Provide a consistent and cohesive family appearance to all
workplan point-of-sale pieces that are placed both in and outside the store. As

we begin to build Maverick’s long—term brand identity, all workplan pieces will feature
Maverick’s signature Black and Gold colors via:

0 Black backgrounds instead of a combination of black and grey backgrounds.

O Maverick’s gold signature icon (either “Maverick” brand name alone or
coupled with the triangular logo and falcon).

Where room permits, “The Real Deal” headline will be used. The supporting tagline,
“Real Taste, Great Deal”, however, will no longer be used. When this tagline was used
on previous quarters’ workplans, it connoted mostly a price or value positioning.
Without using the tagline, however, allows consumers to draw their own conclusions
about the brand, like a great quality product or “a brand of cigarettes that’s for me”.

Additionally, photos of Maverick packs will be featured on all pieces that are intended
for placement away from the display (i.e., 2X2 panel holders) to help confirm that
Maverick is a brand of cigarettes.

Tactics:
0 All old quarterly workplan pieces must be removed and replaced with new 3”
quarter workplan materials.

0 The 4, 6 and 8—wide riser strips that incorporate pricing areas must be used in
conjunction with all 4, 6 and 8—wide riser cards.

The revised format is more "user friendly" than the earlier
chart, but still provides all necessary information.

We are continuing to edit the list. The final draft
will contain approximately the same number of food examples
for each ingredient. Because some of the ingredients are

‘Preliminary taste evaluations have been made on
menthol samples received from UHE Co. and Manheimer.
A copy of the report is attached.

Although neither sample was rated quite equivalent
to the current production Brazilian in taste charac-
teristics, they are both probably within the range of
acceptability. The UHE Brazilian was preferred over
the Manheimer Penguin Brand. The latter sample was
designated as being Formosan but the ratio of neo-
menthol to neoisomenthol indicates that the menthol
is from plants grown in Brazil.

P00165 Method Application

The analytical precision curve for the two-stage gold amalgamation system was further studied with a

concentration range from 0.1 ng up to 10 ng of Hg. As expected, the precision at the low concentration

was not as good as at the high concentration, 5.9 % RSD for 0.1 ng Hg verse 0.3 % RSD for 10 ng Hg.

0 The individual trap efﬁciency of 11 Au—Pt traps was studied by the purge-and-trap of 5 ng of Hg standard.
The maximum difference was found being less than 1% that indicates the precise set-up for the two stage

gold amalgamation system.

The trap efﬁciency of Au»Pt gauze was studied by connecting two Au-Pt traps in serial and the mercury

amount was analyzed independently. The amount of mercury breakthrough, based on the second Au—Pt

trap, was found to be 1% for 5 ng ong and 1.5% for 10 ng of Hg.

The instrument LOD, 0.011 ng, was determined based on 10 replicates of purge and trap of reagent blanks.

The method LOD, 0.1 ng, was also determined based on 10 replicates of smoking blanks.

3 ng of Hg was spiked onto the Au trap before smoking the 1R4F cigarette for method accuracy study.

Only 60% recovery of Hg was recovered, which can not justify the performance of gold trap. Two reasons

for this poor recovery, one is that the amount of Au was not enough to trap both mercury and volatile

organic vapor passing through electrostatic precipitation, and the other is the deactivation of the Au trap

caused by some organic vapor. To solve this problem, a catalyst converter is going to be placed before

gold trap to decompose organic vapor before the gas phase of smoke entering the Au trap.

FROM: Ronald S. Milstein, Vice President, General Couns
RE: Retention of Records for Antitrust Lawsuit (Lorillard v.

Philip Morris)

 

Lorillard recently sued Philip Morris, Incorporated
("Philip Morris") in federal court in Greensboro, charging that Philip
Morris is attempting to unlawfully monopolize the retail cigarette

market through its "Retail Leaders" merchandising program.
Lorillard' s lawsuit has been consolidated with similar suits brought

by R. J. Reynolds and Brown & Williamson. Our lawsuit charges that
Philip Morris‘ Retail Leaders program violates federal and state
antitrust laws because it requires retailers to commit to exclusionary
levels of display of Philip Morris brands, preventing Lorillard and
other competitors from effectively displaying and advertising their
brands. The judge in the case has issued a preliminary injunction
that prevents Philip Morris from enforcing the more restrictive
provisions of the Retail Leaders program. We expect that our suit
will proceed to trial next spring.

As part of the pretrial proceedings, Philip Morris has
served Lorillard with a request for documents, and we require your
immediate assistance in helping the Company respond to this request.
Please review this memo carefully, determine if you have any documents
relating to the subjects set forth below, and segregate and retain all
such documents until further notice You should then notify your
supervisor and/or Jack Reilly, Associate General Counsel, Litigation
(extension 7703) about the existence of such documents with an
estimation of their volume (preferably by file drawer or box). Under
no circumstances should you discard any document that relates to these

TO: Executive Committee

FR: Samuel D. Chilcote, Jr.:EEEE§3**'

Today the Senate Finance Committee conducted%its third and
final day of hearings on revenue options. The hearing was
chaired for most of the time by Sen. Max Baucus (D-MT);
Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D-TX) attended for just a short
period of time. Other Senators in attendance included Thomas
Daschle (D-SD), Donald Riegle (D-MI), Daniel Moynihan (D-NY),
Bill Bradley (D-NJ), and John Chafee (R-RI). The witness
list and selected testimony are attached.

 

Highlights include:

o Rudy Oswald, Director, Economic Research Department,
AFL-CIO, opposed any new or expanded sales, excise, or other
consumption taxes. "It is our strong belief that any new
revenues be raised on the basis of ability to pay," Oswald
said, adding, "regressive taxes are contrary to the goal of
tax justice and intent of Congress in enacting the 1986
reforms." Oswald encouraged the Committee "to focus its
attention on the individual and corporate income tax and the

estate and gift tax."

0 Paul Huard, Vice President, Taxation and Fiscal Policy,
National Association of Manufacturers, opposed any changes to
individual or corporate taxes or selectively imposed excise
taxes. "We oppose without exception any change that would
increase federal revenues derived from selectively-imposed
excise taxes," he said. Huard characterized excise taxes as
"undeniably regressive.“ He added, "If Congress is
determined to raise additional federal tax revenues, it
should only be done by imposing a consumption—type tax at a
uniform rate on the broadest possible base of taxable goods

andiservices."

SUBJECT: Kent Golden Light Menthol

Based on‘the information I have obtained; the extra-
polated sales oﬁ KGL on an annualized, national basis will
be approximately five (5) billion units, It would appear
that an unusually good opportunity to increase the sales
impact of this brand will be missed if we do not introduce
a KGL Menthol-

The supportive data for this opinion is shown in‘Tables
l and 2, These tables list the available sales data for
brands that have been introdhcedlsince 1966 with‘a companion
menthol. Table l ShOWS‘the‘SaleS of competitive products as
reported by Maxwell and Table 2 lists the sales of Lorillard
products as reported by Maxwell, except where noted.

As can be seen, the average percent of sales of the
menthol products relative to the nonrmenthol for the com—
petitive brands is 54%, and for the Eorillard brands 57.6%.
Assuming this data would translate if a KGL Menthol was
introduced, the anticipated‘sales of the menthol brand
would be approximately two to three billion units during
the first year of introduction.

In evaluating the data shown in the Tables” it should
be remembered that one of the most acceptedwmethods of fore—
casting sales trends is;a technique called "exponential
smoothing". This simply means that the most recent data is
given the most weight in the forecast. Because oﬁ this, any
data for brands introduced before l966 would be superfluous
for this type of forecasting. It can also be seen that if
only the brands which have been{introduced recently are
considered, then the percent of menthol sales relative to
the non—menthol would be greater than 60%.

Aqueous m-sol-Gel. A preliminary technical package describing the
synthesis of the aqueous non-sol-gel material has been compiled with Dr. II.
8. Edwards. This package is being forwarded to two vendors for scale-up
consideration.

Calciu- carbonata. rive papers were received from the handsheet lab,
surprising 25! PICS magnesite and 15! of various calcium carbonates, at 45
grams/In“ basis weight, 4.2 to 6.5 Coresta porosity, and 6-7! nominal
potassium succinate sizing. the calcites involved: Multifex MM, macar,
Albaglos, microns 3, and Pfizer’s Heavy ,5931 Pcc USP/FCC. The papers are
being evaluated for sidestream reduction and elemental analysis.

Machine-made papers were prepared at the University of Maine using four
different calcites as filler. The four calcites, Albacar 597D. Microna 3,
Multifex MM, and Micro-White 25, were chosen because of their similar
particle size (-5 m, Malvern Analyzer), different morphology, and commercial
availability. -

Bydr-agmaita. sidestream reduction results were received for a series of 7

papers prepared from five variously prepared samples of coarse
hydromgnesita. Sidestraam reductions ranged from 63 to 80! (static burn
time 8.8 to 11.6 minutes) . The ash color was about average while adhesion,
fall-off, and solidity were poor. These papers were porous (5.4 to 8.2
Coresta) compared to those derived from many of the previously examined
hydromagnesites, yet were effective in sidestream reduction.

PHILIP MORRIS U.S.A.
lNTER-QFHCE CORRESPONDENCE
anM0~avmemm

Due October 11, 1990

The attached procedures have been developed for the inventory and maintenance of
records for your functional area. The procedures have been reviewed and
endorsed by the Records Management Joint Task Force, the Philip Morris USA Legal

Department, and the law firm of Hunton and Williams. The implementation of
these procedures is dependent upon the Records Management Inventory System being

fully operational. According to the Information Services Department, the system
will be fully operational by December 31, 1990.

The procedures are in compliance with the Philip Morris USA Records Management
Manual with one exception. The Philip Morris USA Records Management Manual
states that Disposal Notices are signed by functional heads, whereas these
procedures indicate that Disposal Notices are signed by department managers.

The Philip Morris USA Records Management Manual will be revised to indicate that

this is the responsibility of department managers.

It has been recommended to the Records Management Joint Task Force that these
procedures be included in the Philip Morris USA Records Management Manual as an

appendix, and a decision on this matter is pending.

These procedures should prove to be highly beneficial in assuring that your
department's records are managed in accordance with the Philip Morris USA
Records Management Program, and it is anticipated that you will realize greater
efficiency in managing records upon implementation of these procedures.

If you have any questions or require interpretation of these procedures, please
contact me at extension 5949.

SUBJECT: Experimentation Using Charcoal to Remove Nitrogen
Oxides from Cigarette Smoke (PROJECT B 451, CMP)

In an earlier memorandum, I outlined work using charcoal impreg-
nated with 1.3—butadiene as a filter additive to reduce nitrogen
oxide (NOX) delivery in mainstream smoke (1). This experimen-
tation indicated that cigarettes containing either untreated
charcoal or butadiene impregnated charcoal had lower Nox delivery
than cigarettes containing no charcoal. The question arose as to
whether NOX delivery could be reduced using untreated charcoal
and whether NOx delivery was related to the amount of untreated
charcoal used.

Experimentation has been carried out to address these issues.
The results from this experimentation seem to contradict the
previously obtained data that N0x delivery can be reduced using
charcoal filters. No reduction in N0x delivery was seen using
untreated charcoal. Additionally, no relationship was seen
between the amount of untreated charcoal used and the NOx deliv-
ery.

Two possible sources of this contradictory data include variabil—
ity of the method used to assay NOx delivery or inhomogeneity in
the nitrate content of the tobacco in the experimental ciga-
rettes. Further experimentation will be performed to help
clarify the results.

EXPERIMENTAL

A carton of 1188-93 cigarettes was removed from the freezer and
allowed to stand at room temperature for 24 hours. The cigaret—
tes were then weight selected and those weighing from 1.06 to
1.09 grams were retained. Calgon type PCB 12 X 30 mesh charcoal
was incorporated into the cigarettes. The charcoal was added by
removing the outer filter portion, placing the charcoal in the
cavity, and reinserting the outer filter portion. Any part of
the filter that extended beyond the tipping paper was cut off.
The amounts of charcoal incorporated into the filters were 50.
90. 140, and 180 milligrams. Controls containing no charcoal
were prepared by removing the outer filter portion in each
cigarette and then reinserting it.

Subject: Various - MPID

A few suggestions regarding various pieces of information to be considered for inclusion in
MPID reports:

llz

Minor Manufacturers/Brand Report

Too much emphasis is placedlon share of market analysis (see report dated 3/6): and not
enough on proviciing volume Clara. ?ercentage gains/losses ofshare is really not very
relevant as opposed to this comparison based on volume. The report should include
adrlitional information related to volumes, i.e., annual shipments for 1998 and 3999, year-
to—date 2000, and an attempt to project annualized volumes for 20003 as well as
percentage changes. This does not have to be developed to the division ieveL but could
be helpful either on a regional or area basis. The report tends to dwell on what occurred
in the past. This is good up to a point, however, some hypothesizing as to future; would
be better. Since this report is based on Excel data, we should also consider similar
additions to the MSA shipment analyses.

Pricing Comparisons

Some time ago, we discussed developing average pricing comp atisons to establish a
history as well as a current picture of the percentage differentials between the various
price segments ofthe market. What is the status of this information?

Given the growing importance of minor brands, we should include, wherever possible, a
complete View of the market by including the minors along with the majors. I am not
certain of the availability of the minor sales data. A review should be moxie to determine
what is available and how this information can be Excluded as part of the on-going
analyses.

MEMORANDUM June 6 ' 1 9 8 9

To: H. J. Minnemeyer
FROM: J. H. Bell

SUBJECT: Cigarette Modification Project Report

On Friday May 12 the writer met with Ms. S. Ireland and Dr. J.
Reid to discuss a concern for a more concentrated effort in the
reduction of certain cigarette smoke components which have been
targeted in the cigarette modification project. Ms. Ireland and
Dr. Reid were most receptive to the suggestion that a re-direc—
>tion of some activities was in order.

A catechol/phenol analysis has been developed and demonstrated by
the writer. However, the method involves the same instrumenta—
tion that is used for the BAP analysis. The sharing of this
equipment proved to be very clumsy and resulted in a less effi-
cient laboratory operation. Ms. Ireland has agreed to accept
this analysis into her section and has assigned Dr. Aruna Prakash
as the investigator. A Perkin-Elmer LS-4O Fluorescence Spectro-
meter will be needed and is being purchased at this time.

Dr. Reid was agreeable to the suggestion that Dr. Paul
SchickedantZ's contribution to this project could best be made in
the investigation of carbonyl removal. Methodologies from lab 10
will be transferred immediately to Dr. Schickedantz. Analytical
procedures can be established in his laboratory in one week. The
actual smoking of cigarettes and the proper use of the smoke
collection system may be an initial problem. However, smoke
samples can be provided to him until a more proficient protocol

is devised.

The NNN analysis which has always been run in‘the Tobacco Science
Section will remain in that section, but will be done under the
scrutiny of Dr. F. Perini. The results of the analysis have been
rather erratic over the last few months. Variations in ng/cig or
ppm have been as high as 100% while some recoveries have been as
low as 1.5%. Dr. Perini will investigate these problems and make
the necessary procedural changes. In addition, he has been asked
to include NNK with the analysis. This will entail a more
sophisticated clean-up procedure which dOes not include decolo-

rizing charcoal.

Subject: Current Theoretical Considerations on the Origin of MS NNK from
Water-Washed Fillers and Basewebs

Hot water washing (as in the RL process) results in base webs (BWsw
with greatly reduced MS NNN and NAT levels relative to‘corresponding levels
from feedstock, but MS NNK levels are not reduced‘by this process.” The same
phenomenon occurs when out filler is exhaustively washed with water at room
temperature.2 The MS NNK delivered by water-washed fillers and BWs‘ has been
referred to as pyrosynthetic NNK. I“ '

The pyrosynthetic formation of TSNA in MS smoke has been studied for'
several years by Project 6908.’ Although not included in official documentab
tion previously, the most common hypothesis used to explain the ﬁailure of
water extraction to remove the source of MS NNK was as follows: there is a
water-insoluble amine precursor remaining: in‘ the extracted filler which‘
reacts with a nitrosating agent, also derived from a water-insoluble source,
to form NNK. The water—insoluble amine precursor undergoes pyrolytic clea-
vage, either before or after nitrosation, and then the NNK transfers to Ms.
Alternatively, bound nicotine itself may be nitrosated during smoking. NOne
of the above theories include any explanation of how or when these MS NNK
precursors are formed. As a‘result of recent discussions in Project 6908; a
new hypothesis has been advancedi which encompasses most of the previous
theories as well as some new ideas; The current hypothesis is stated below:

some of the nicotine present in tobacco becomes bound before curing iscomplete. Part of
the bound nicotine is oxidized to bloundpseudooiynicotine (PsON) or a related NNK precursor,
and‘at‘ least‘ a portion of this bound precursor is nitrosated ‘during eating to yield bound
NNK, while a: portion may remain in nitrosatablefonn; Water extraction does not removed]!
bound NNK or the remaining bound ‘ NNK precursors“ NNK is‘released from the boundfonn
and is also pyrosynthesized‘from bound NNK precursors (or from! bound nicotine): during
smoking, and the total NNK released partially transfers as MS ‘NNK or is decomposed during
the smoking process.

In the remainder of this memo, the derivation oi the above hypothesis
is described} andlplans that have been made to substantiate these concepts
are briefly presented.

WN$E Misty Slims Flash Report (12(03ﬁ89)

American Tobacco began retail distribution of Misty Slims in
Bakersfield, California and Shreveport, Louisiana in August.
The brand is being tested at full margin in Bakersfield and

at generic prices in Shreveport.

According to sources in the wholesale trade, Full Priced
Misty Slims will expand its test to the state of California
and to Atlanta, Georgia in December, 1989.

Misty Slims’ share remained at 0.4 in Shreveport
(Generic Priced) and increased one-tenth in Bakersfield
(Full Priced) to 1.0, from the previous period.

Similar to when last reported, the share difference
between the two markets appears to be due to the higher
levels of promotional support in Bakersfield, where 81%
of stores have at least one Misty Slims promotion
versus 20% in Shreveport.

Bakersfield’s incentives include BlGlF’s, $3 off carton
purchase, free eye make-up with carton purchase and
free magazine (up to $3 value) with carton purchase.
The pantyhose with carton purchase and BlGlF's continue
to be reported in Shreveport’s outlets. In addition,
only one store offered the free magazine with carton
promotion in the generic priced market.

For the past two months, Shreveport’s distribution has
remained relatively constant at 64%. However,
distribution has increased +6% to 73% in Bakersfield.

Parliament brand since the early l960‘s. Please check this information
and let me know if there are errors or deficiencies.

,,As we noted in our conversation, interest is centered on changes which
would be obvious to a consumer; for example, recess vs. no recess, changes

in tipping length or filter construction, single vs. dual filters and
length of filters.

Most important would be to supply information prior to l96l which,I trust,
will be in the Manufacturing Department‘s files.

Attorneys General Proposed Settlement

Earlier today you received Geoff Bible’s desk drop on the proposed settlement with
the state attorneys general. I want to take this opportunity to reiterate that this is
just the beginning of the process and until we know that the requisite number of
states agree to participate, it is premature for us to discuss any of the implications of

this agreement.

I intend to address all PM USA employees early in December with my “state of the

From: Barry Holt
Subject: Media Begueet -- QAPI [AL (Franeet

As you‘ll remember from my previous memo, Eric Wattez, a

reporter with the French business monthly Game}, is writing a
cover story on Philip Morris Companies Inc. He would like to

interview you sometime between September 2-15 or after
September 20.

Baekgreund:

Qapital, is the leading French economic / business magazine. It is
published by the Prisma Group and has ties with the German
group, Gruener 8: Iahr, which publishes the German edition of

Capita-

The French Qapital was introduced in October 1991 and met with
immediate success. It surpassed the then-leading French economic

monthly, L'ﬂxpmeign. Today, Capital's circulation has reached
almost 300,000.

Qapital employs somewhat unusual angles: it tries to 'humanize'
its stories, making the economy and business readable and
appealing to everybody.

Qapital normally devotes one 5 to 6 page story to a large company
which is in the news because of its success (or failure.) Mr. Wattez

is preparing such a story on PM -- as an example of success. He
has already interviewed Walter Thoma (President, EC), Michael

Horst (EC) and Ray Viault (Jacobs Suchard). He has also seen PM
sponsorship in action by attending the Monaco Formula 1 Grand

Prix.

SUBJECT: Tobacco Inventory for ATCo.

Should Lorillard purchase the subject brands from BWT, we suspect that tobaccos in
our inventories will be compatible to some of the tobaccos used in their blends. However,
we are certain their blends include tobaccos not available in our inventory.

Depending on the availability in our inventories and/or the marketplace, we will need
to purchase from BWT, a minimum of 24 months inventory of some grades used in the
products, as of July 1, 1995.

We estimate that should Lorillard purchase these brands, we would need to increase

our inventories by approximately $60 million.

inquired about (1) a U.S.—Turkish bi—lateral trade

agreement signed in February, and (2) a preposal to
establish a joint Economic Commission under the State
Department.

1.

CC:

Attached is a Federal Register notice (50 E5 8428,
March 1, 1985) announcing that the U.S. recognizes
Turkey as signatory on the GATT Subsidies Code. The
agreement was signed February 25, 1985. I am informed
that, in order for the U.S. to recognize a country under
the agreement, a bi-lateral trade agreement must be
reached that would have the following results: a
country (Turkey in this case) would agree to phase out
export sibsidies and in return the U.S. would entitle
the country to injury tests in countervailing duty and
anti-dumping regulations with the U.S. International
Trade Commission. Sources at U.S. Commerce Department
indicate Turkey desired the protection afforded by the

ITC injury tests and, therefore, agreed to phase out its
export subsidies.

The Government of Turkey has proposed to the United
States that annual economic consultations between the
two countries commence this year. The U.S. is currently
considering such a meeting this year only. Under
Secretary of Economic Affairs for the U.S. Department of
State W. Allen Wallis is tentatively scheduled to visit
Turkey on June 5 and 6, 1985. No decision will be made
regarding future economic meetings until the U.S.
reviews the initial consultations. state Department
sources say nothing exists on paper regarding the
proposed economic commission at this time.

We have been asked by sources at the ITA Turkey desk at

the Commerce Department if we have any problems or
points we would like to have raised at the tentative

June 5 and 6 meeting. If so, please contact me as soon
as possible. I understand the agenda is wide open at

this time.

/
SUBJECT: Vapor Phase Analysis on Recently Submitted Samples

The organic vapor phase, HCN. and permanent gas analysis

are complete for Fact, 4092, 4093, MAX, L. T. Brown, and
Saratoga. Fact is a 85 mm cigarette being test marketed by

Brown and Williamson. The cigarette has a specially constructed
filter containing a smoke filtering resinl probably Duolite A-2,
manufactured by Diamond Shamrocﬁy Samples 4092 and 4093 are

the prototype of the Kent Golden Lights. The remaining samples
are commercially available cigarettes; The results of this
study are given in the attached table.»

The only parameter that is substantially different for
Fact, as compared to other 85 mm cigarettes, is HCN. The.
resinous filter additive apparently removes approximately

50 percent of the HCN.

' The permanent gas analysis indicates approximately 40 percent
air dilution for Samples 4092 and 4093. Undoubtedly, 4092 and
4093 should have very low tar and nicotine levels.

vThe striking similarity in the organic vapor phase for
85 mm and 120 mm‘cigarettes is probably due to a fortuitous
combination of circumstances, such as similar tobacco weights,
longer burn time, and more air dilution for 120 mm cigarettes.
The affect of air dilution for 120 mm‘cigarettes becomes very
apparent in the comparison of C0/N2 and C02/N2 ratios from the

permanent gas data.

RE: August2 1976 Status Report

Here's how the major work stands.

NEW BRAND DEVELOPMENT

SHF/UHF — Top—line results from quantitative concept evaluation
indicate that "50% lower nicotine" has strong potential. We

are starting product and advertising development on this concept.
This, along with business/marketing planning, is aimed toward

a 1/77 test market. We plan to select 3 or h more concepts

from analysis of the complete data (including - for sure — one
menthol SHF concept) during the week of 8/23.

Nowland‘s first report on their basic work with health—concerned
smokers will be made in late August. Their work will be com—
pleted in late 1976. We plan to select from Nowland ideas and
high technology concepts — and go to in-market evaluation in
mid—1977 and beyond.

Perceived Economy — Twelve concepts are being produced for
quantitative evaluation. Top—line results will be available

in early October. We plan to be in—market with low technology
products during the first quarter of 1977.

Synectics II — Work is proceeding on major projects:

— MRD will shortly recommend how we can best
identify (quantify) high—potential cigarette
smoking segments; who, why, how many. This
is likely to be a long—range study - but we
will separate it into manageable,specific
building steps.

— Following discussions with R&D/Operations,
MCA will lay out a specific procedure for
adding projects to the 5 Year Plan. This
procedure will be an expansion of a system
that has been established in Greensboro for
some time. 4.

Subject: CAPITAL APPROPRIATION REQUEST - WEL CLEAN-UP SYSTEM - PARK 500

Attached is an Appropriation Request for $172,000 capital and
$3,000 retirement expense to upgrade the weak extracted liquor
(WEL) system on Line III at Park 500. This proposal will improve
the facilities yield by reducing the amount of rich brown water
(RBW) discharged to Waste Water Treatment. ,

In the RL process, foreign material is removed from incoming
tobacco through a tramp material eliminator and high density
cleaners. These devices utilize fresh water as the separation and
cleaning medium. By converting the separation medium from water to
WEL, additional RBN can be utilized.

Weak extracted liquor is the RL process filtrate from the second
pressing Operation. It is re-input for dilution in the Line III
blending wet slurry and the stock preparation steps. If more of
the WEL stream is used in the blend preparation, an additional
amount of the RBw stream can be used as process dilution in stock
preparation. RBw is the filtrate from the Machine Room, the excess
of which is discharged to Waste Treatment. ‘

The WEL recycle stream will have to be upgraded to use it as a
separation fluid; tobacco fibers must be removed and the stream
heated. Heating the NEL will ensure control of microbiological
activity. Implementation of this proposal will accomplish both
requirements and hence allow 387,696 pounds of tobacco to be saved
annually (Attachment 1). This project has an ROI of 19.2% and a
payback period of 4.9 years by avoiding scrap tobacco purchases.

This project was included in the 1990 Third Revised Capital

Forecast for $250,000 and was not included in the 1990-1994 Five
Year Plan.

RECORDS MANAGEMENT PROGRAM

Following is an update on what has transpired concerning the Records
Management Program in the Leaf Department since I last wrote to you in March.

On August 6, 1991, the second revised issue of the Leaf Department records
retention schedule received the endorsements required for finalization. All
copies of the two previously issued schedules should now be disposed. I was
recently informed by Jane Newchok that one additional modification was still
required. 'However, since the requested change did not affect the maintenance
or retention of records, I would prefer to postpone revising your schedule
again until more critical changes are also needed. Our Records Management
legal counsel has been made aware of this issue and agrees.

The record category "Blend Sheets B1082" was placed under disposal suspension
by the Records Management legal counsel on July 23, 1991. These records have
been flagged in the Records Management data base and should not appear on any
disposal notices until the suspension has been released. I will let you know
when this occurs.

This month, 14 employees in the Leaf department were trained on the final
phase of the Records Management Program implementation. The diskettes to
capture their inventory data were distributed during this training session.
This month, I have started reporting their progress on this phase of
implementation. Attached is a chart showing the information that will be
reported monthly until this final phase of implementation has been completed.
I hope this will assist you in continuing to monitor the progress of the
Records Management Program implementation in the Leaf Department.

Reconciliation of inactive Leaf Department records in storage to your
approved departmental retention schedule continued throughout this reporting
period. I estimate this activity is about 80% complete. Based on the volume
of Leaf records to be addressed, we plan to complete your department in
October 1991. I will continue to inform you periodically of our progress.

The revised PM USA Records Management Manual has been approved by the Records
Management Joint Task Force and the President of Philip Morris USA. It will
be distributed soon from the Legal Department in New York. I will let you
and your departmental records coordinator know before this takes place.

Subject: Low Sidestream Cigarette Papers

Enclosed are seventeen bobbins of low sidestream paper for your model development.
There are three different gradesrepresented in the two boxes we are shipping to you due to
limited availablity of one of the grades. We supplemented the same two Kimberly-Clark
grades you have used before (044 and 049) with a new gradethat was made in May, 94 with a
modiﬁed ﬁber reﬁning process(grade 085). Descriptions of all three grades are listed
below. The bobbins that have been perforated by ESP have a -P written inside the core,
while the non-perforated bobbins have a -N after the code.

Grade 044 is the commercial paper used on our Superslims cigarettes. There may be
another mill trial to reproduce grade 049 towards the end of July, but until then there is
no more paper available of that grade. We also have a very limited supply of a paper with a
basis weight of 47 g/m2 . If you think you might need an intermediate weight paper for
faster burn rate or a lower Coresta paper for additional sidestream reduction, we can ship

more samples at a later date.

ﬂeater Z Lighter Development:

Heater Development:

- PM 50 and PM 80 were received and tested for heater creep. We saw no signiﬁcant improvement of
mechanical stability under heating. ORNL is looking into their ability to enhance the stability by heat
treating. In addition, we are trying our own tests using ovens available at R&D.

' An alternative strategy to increasing the strength of the heater material, at elevated temperatures, is to
investigate the feasibility of lowering the heater operating temperature (creep is extremely sensitive to small
changes in temperature) while maintaining the required heat transfer to the cigarette (thus maintaining
subjective character). We have identiﬁed the required energy proﬁle to attain a constant temperature for a
given heater. This energy proﬁle will be tested for subjective impact once the virtual lighter is complete.

- Ceramx sleeve testing is in progress. The sleeves are functioning as expected.

- We have received carbon-impregnated acetate sleeves from AFC. These will be used to assess the
replaceable condensate control system.

Lighter Development:

' Fiﬁeen lighters were brought back from Sanyo. Some minor problems with heater shorts and ﬂow sensors
occurred. These are now being corrected. All heaters will be disassembled and ﬂow tubes reversed to
improve subjectives. During the disassembly the heaters will be inspected for potential shorts and ﬁxed as
needed.

- The BFL (Big Flexible Lighter) now has the capability of monitoring heater proﬁle. We are developing the
ability to modulate the energy to The heater.

Energy Storage:

- A simple simulation of heater temperature dynamics has been initiated using a commercial soﬁware package.
With it's use, results of using various power modulation schemes can be easily visualized. Incorporation of a
more rigorous heater model from A. D. Little into the simulation is being pursued.

Subject: Annual Accomplishmentsf‘t

The Chemical Applications Section of the Chemical Research Division consists of
two projects, Inorganic Synthesis led by Ken Podraza and Organic Synthesis led by‘Yoram
Houminer. The reorganization which led to the current reporting system within CRD occurred
in July 1991‘. Pleasereview the attached highlights of the annual accomplishments in,
preparation for the Annual ReviewMeeting to beheld next Wednesday, February 5, 1992, at 10
am in A1 Conference Room

Both projects, together, provide fundamental and applied core technologies in
areas of organic, inorganic, physical, environmental, thermal and analytical chemistry, in
addition to separation science, sensory technology, tobacco alkaloid chemistry and
pharmacology, and to lesser extent, in the areas of radiol‘abelled synthesis, materials
science, paper technology, and encapsulation chemistry.

The Inorganic Chemistry project has devoted the major portion of its 1991 effort
to the development of novel, proprietary inorganic ﬁllers which, when incorporated into
paper and cigarettes, results in signiﬁcantly reduced visible sidestream smoke with
acceptable subjectives and ashcharacteristics. In addition, this project has participated
in the development of technologies for use in various environmental issues which: face our

manufacturingfacilities;

The Organic Chemistry project has participated in the development of a stable
menthol delivery product as well as in the development of materials which will reduce the
irritation percepts of sidestream smoke, primarily in the or-hexylcinnamaldehyde (HCA)
release area. In the last few months, the project hasbegun to investigate the chemistry of

various Cast Leaf, NBL, andSrelated processes. In particular, the rate of pectin release,
the effect of particle size on sheet parameters, and alternative binders arebeing examined.

As I read the amendment, it would call for the
full disclosure of all additives and contaminants of
tobacco and tobacco products. The disclosure would be
xin a form of a listing on the label. I think the
proposed amendment is completely impractical and unwork-
able. The disclosure list would be extraordinarily long A-
.and probably would not fit on a label. I know of no
.wproduct where such a complete disclosure is required.
*However, there are countries where limits are set for
pesticide residues, for example, and as long as the
,limits are not exceeded, the product is acceptable and_
Sno disclosure is required. This kind of approach is
1practical, but a complete listing as called for in

the amendment has no practicality. I trust that-

you will communicate.as appropriate, this position.

I am well aware of this organization and can readily endorse
it mainly by its reputation. I, personally, have never
attendedy the PTC meetings, but those who have speak highly
of the work and objectives of this group. This Institute
investigates various problems in the field of intellectual
and industrial property and its association with the George
Washington University enhances the Institute' 5 ability to
attract qualified persons to conduct the necessary studies

to fulfill its objectives.

The DuPont Company actively supports this endeavor and Samuel
Lenher, a DuPont vice president, is on its advisory council.
I am not certain which other companies support the Institute,
but I would imagine companies such as G.E., IBM, Monsanto,
etc., which have large patent programs are contributorsi If
you would like a list of contributors, I believe I couldlget

one for you.

The work of this Institute is worthwhile and my recommendation
would be for Philip Morris to support the PTC Institute. I
would think the minimum amount of $500 to be a participating

member would be an adequate subscription.

Subject: Recovery of Tobacco Neutrals from Water Column Effluent

The removal of hydrophobic organic compounds from aqueous effluents is
a well-known technology. For example, Bitteur and Rosset (J. Food Science

:3, 141 (1988) describe the use of octadecyl-bonded silica (0-18) and
styrene-divinylbenzene to recover blackcurrant aroma compounds from food
plant waste water. These packings selectively retain organic compounds
while inorganic salts and ionic organic compounds pass through unretained,
We reasoned that the acidic water column effluent could be pumped through C-
18 packing and the organic "flavor" components could be retained while the
protonated bases, e.g., nicotine, would pass through.

We have carried out an experiment to test this hypothesis (Notebook
8889-69). Specifically, to lOOOg of ART MPG solution was added at room
temperature 20g of Baker reversed phase packing (octadecylsilane bonded to
silica gel, 40 micron particle diameter). This suspension was stirred
vigorously for one hour and then filtered through a coarse fritted glass
funnel. The solids (yellowish in color) were washed with two 500ml portions

of water. Nicotine analyses for the filtrate and washings were as follows:

Filtrate 27.719

lst Wash ' ' I {675

2nd Wash .038
Total 28.432g

The nicotine content of the initial solution was 29.4g; thus nearly 97%
of the nicotine passed through the packing.

After the second washing with water, the packing was air-dried for
about 2 hours. The packing showed a weight gain of 0.25 grams. The dried
packing was slurried with about 30ml 95% ethanol and filtered by suction.
The packing was rinsed with two 10- ml portions of ethanol, at which point
the packing was colorless. After drying the packing weighed 19. 5g, probably
due to mechanical loss. The yellow ethanol solution has a rich tobacco
aroma and will be evaluated by the odor profile panel; it is available for
subjective evaluation in cigarettes as well.

Since this result is so promising, we plan to perform additional
experiments to evaluate the capacity of the 0-18 packing. An alternate
packing material is a styrene-divinylbenzene co-polymer.

We will order some of this material for studies to compare with the C-
18 data. The styrene-divinylbenzene packing can be used over a pH range of
1-14 whereas the 0-18 is limited to pH 3-6 by its chemical reactivity.

INVESTIGATION OF SMOKE AEROSOL

BY

.—-—

W

PART VII

February 1266

A characteristic property of smoke
aerosol droplets is their ability under certain
conditions to separate into two virtually distinct
phases. In most of our work to date we have
devoted our attention to the use of screens and
methods of collection that avoided this separation,
because we were hoping to get information bearing
on the aerosol particles as they actually are in
the free state. Even when we found that passage
through a carbon filter increased the tendency of
the droplets to spread we endeavoured to use screens
which limited this to spreading of the droplet as a
whole and stopped short of phase separation.

We discussed "spreading" in some detail
on pp. 7, 8, and 9. of our report PART V. April 1965,
and we include at Plate I. of that report a
reproduction of a photograph showing what we there
termed "a typical case of advanced spreading". In
this case the spreading was due to the aerosol
having passed through a charcoal filter. We have
now carried out some further experiments which%
while preliminary, suggest how this phenomena might
be further investigated. 4

The criwinal analysis turned out quite unfavorably for Old Gold.
But it led to a discovery which explains the results. and by thick,

to all indications, Old Gold can easily produce the best "bill of
health" of all {our brands.

This observation is almost absurdly simple, yet it has never been
noted as far as Professor MacTavish can learn, in any of the
scientific literature on the cigarette. It is the fact that the
amount of moisture present in the tobacco — br to put it another
way - the "freshness" of the cigarette — controls the quantity of
irritating substances formed during combustion. The dryer thﬂ
cigarette, the more irritating. And a difference in the amount
or moisture, which would be imperceptible to the smoker, can
violently effect the results of an analysis.

MaCTavish deduced this fact from a study of the results of his
first test. But to prove it he made a simple test of the smoke
from the four cigarettes under controlled moisture conditions
and by adding only 2% to Old Gold's moisture was able to make
it show up much better than any cigarette in the original test.

The reason for this powerful influence of moisture on the amount
or irritants formed is apparently that the butt and of the ciga-
rette (when the tobacco is relatively moist or "fresh") acts as

‘a condenser and withholds some or the natural irritants from
passing into the throat.

But before discussing the possibilities of using this observation
to Old Gold‘s advantage, it would be best to review the original
analysis of the four cigarettes. The four brands were bought at
‘ the same time at the United Cigar store in the Grand Central Stn‘
' tion, and the dealer told Professor MscTevish that they had all

been r8061VCd that morning from the wholesaler. Presumably they
were equally fresh. But yOu will observe in the results a con-
siderable difference in moisture content.

These are the highlights of the original smoke analysis: 1::

MEMORANDUM

To: Martin Gleason
Susan Stuntz

FROM: Powell Adams & Rinehart
Savarese and Associates

SUBJECT: Luc state Tax strategy

This document will outline a Labor Management Committee state tax
strategy for the remainder of 1990 and 1991. The strategy is
based upon the information provided us in the October 1990
"Cigarette Excise Legislation Priority 1 States" document.

RESOUICOS

In order to shape the state excise tax debate and influence its
outcome, the LMC will utilize and access existing resources as
well as develop new contacts where possible. Among the resources
available to the Committee are:

- LMC member unions

- non-LMC labor organizations with which the Committee has
working relationships

- LMC state labor consultants

- citizens for Tax Justice

- fair tax/citizen action groups which the Committee
supports

A Fair Tax Message

In virtually each state, it will be essential to frame the debate
as one of fair versus unfair tax policy. By expanding the
discussion beyond cigarette excise taxes, the Committee will be
able to access more of its resources and the program stands a
greater chance of success.

In order to achieve this goal, the Committee will look to the
development or update of tax studies and reports, such as those

FROM: M . B . Bennett

SUBJECT: Status of the 1994 Testing Pregram Budget

Testing Program underspending increased this month by approximately
$109 060. However, this amount is balanced by the July shipment of
test compounds which, due to charges pending guidelines, will net
appear in the budget until next month Again, the balance of
underspending is related to delays in initiaton of subchronic

studies. The remaining subchronic study will be initiated in the
near future.

SUBJECT: Elan Displays

Lou,

We need samples of displays by as early next week as
possible. I know you provided some of these but since the Elan
packs are thinner (like Capri) you recommended resizing them.

Also we need displays for incentive offers, I just wanted you to
know what is still to come.

— Two for one bins, 20 and 40 deals only. The use of 80
has been discontinued.

— Set sell displays (slanted) for 20 horizontal and 20 and
30 vertical.

- Two with Incentive - Incentive will be a carded lighter

with packs of Elan. I don't have the final lighter yet

but will early next week. Offer will be available in two
sizes, 20 and 40 deal.

— A-l On-Carton - No final incentive here either, but

should be done next week. This will be a 30 deal display
only.

Based on cost input from you and Lee Payne, we are taking
another look at the stationery and pre-booking form. We will
have those back to you in a few weeks.

Please call if you have any questions.

NEWPORT: sales on all packings continue be strong‘dme

have good‘distribution and are starting to

strong‘growth in Regions' #14 & #19. The

80 are underway in Regions' #14 & #19) and it
is too early to‘report progress.

STYLE: This brand is selling well in Regions” #14 &
#15. It sells best in Cigarette Stores and
other Buy Down Accounts. Regions’ #16 & #19
reports slow movement due to competitive
activity. In‘aIl Regions, it sells best by
the carton while package sales are slower.

HARLEY DAVIDSON: FULL FLAVOR BOX is doing well in all Regions,
but EIGHTS sales are decreasing. Competitive
promotions appear to be hindering its growth.
In Region #16, this packing’s sales are
increasing due to additional distribution
gains and coupon support. In‘Region #14, it
sells better in Buy Down Accounts.

KENT‘E TRUE: These brands continue to be on a slow but
steady decline in all Regions due to lack of

Based on discussions between Chemical Research, Analytical

compositio The objective for the upcom~.ng studies is to
investigatggghe effect of cigarette circumference and Mg(OH)2

were made at thr e different circumferences (17 mm, 20 mm and 24 8

the same batch of to acco in a nondiluted 100 mm filtered
configuration. Egg

The selected blend was tﬁegcurrent project TRIM blend with standard
production components. DBC Br‘Iht, DBC Burley, MT Oriental, RLTC
and RL 150B was used. It cont ed no stems or expanded tobaccos,
so that better looking ultra slim g arettes could be produced All
samples had the same casing and aﬁfgfcut system.

The Hauni lab max was used for all thre‘ circumferences. Cellulose
acetate filters were made with widely v rying efficiencies in an
effort to keep the mainstream tar deliveries within reasonable
levels. The tables attached to this memo giv’ analytical data for
each of the models. As can be seen in Table , the 17 mm
configuration gave extremely high RTD’s for nonventilated
cigarettes. This could have an effect on mainstream puffing to a
greater extent than for a standard circumference cigarette. Ultra
slim prototypes typically have RTD.!s above 6" water fag 45 — 55%

filter ventilation. The variability of the RTD was also greater for
the slim cigarettes.

FROM: Joann J. Cunningham
SUBJECT: Elan Test Market Timing Confidential

Due to the decision last week to utilize reduced smoke
product on Elan, Brand is recommending a one month delay in the
Elan test market from June 27 to July 25. Doing so will resolve

several issues.

° Final decision of tar and nicotine levels for reduced
smoke.

° Completion of initial testing with reduce smoke product.
° Availability of teartape calling out reduced smoke.

° Sufficient lead time to incorporate reduced smoke in all
materials and ads. ‘

The following outlines timing parameters for all materials.

Management Materials - Brochure and folder have been already
turned over for production without reduced smoke call out,
however, this can be handled with a single page insert in the
folder or on the Sell Sheets which are printed in Black &

White. Trade pieces do not carry T & N's so this is not an
issue.

Richmond Materials — Both the sample 20's and 2 for l
sleeves are in production in Richmond. Mark Walchak confirmed a
last possible day for assembly of June 15 for an August test’
market.

Advertising - Final decisions must be made by June 10 to
meet closing and proofing dates. Once an ad is released it

cannot be changed.

Outdoor - Decision has been made to run approved outdoor.
Only T & N must be changed. Final decision for August test is
first week of June.

Point—of—Sale - As insurance we will produce two separate
sets of point—of—sale materials for the first month. These

materials need to be put into production by mid-May.

Teartape - Landor is working on a "reduced smoke" tape for
review ASAP.

In consideration of the above information, the reduced smoke
product changes can be included in ROP and magazine ads, in

sumcrx ﬁistx Slims Flash Report (12103189) ‘

American Tobacco began retail distribution of Misty Slims in

Bakersfield, California and Shreveport, Louisiana in August.

The brand is being tested at full margin in Bakersfield and

at generic prices in Shreveport.

According to sources in the wholesale trade, Full Priced

Misty Slims will expand its test to the state of California

and to Atlanta, Georgia in December, 1989.

o Misty slims’ share remained at 0.4 in Shreveport
(Generic Priced) and increased one~tenth in Bakersfield
(Full Priced) to 1.0, from the previous period.

Similar to when last reported, the share difference
between the two markets appears to be due to the higher
levels of promotional support in Bakersfield, where 81% _
of stores have at least one Misty Slims promotion

versus 20% in Shreveport.

o Bakersfield’s incentives include BlGlF’s, $3 off carton
purchase, free eye make-up with carton purchase and
free magazine (up to $3 value) with carton purchase.

The pantyhose with carton purchase and BlGlF's continue
to be reported in Shreveport's outlets. In addition,
only one store offered the free magazine with carton
promotion in the generic priced market.

0 For the past two months, Shreveport’s distribution has
remained relatively constant at 64%. However,
distribution has increased +6% to 73% in Bakersfield.

A low pressure trial was run at the Bermda Hundred Factory. Four (4)
loops of filler were extracted at 2400 psi, 140 °F and 150 M/M. Extraction
efficiency met the 9"" target. Cigarettes will be requested in the
low/ultra-low, KS/ 100mm and regular and menthol versions.

Bermuda Hundred nodules HA and 113 achieved targeted extraction
efficiency. Models were made and subjectively evaluated from both.
Subjective approval was given for both Module IIA and IIB for production of
BERN, CIG 8 and (:16 8M filler.

A large—scale casing trial using 89C-392 pilot plant filler has been
completed in Semi-works with a new casing formulation (8611-78-10 .
Cigarettes have been requested with aftercut (8mg) for comparisons to
the current casing, and without aftercut (8, 11, and 15mg) for further
laboratory evaluations of new aftercut systems.

All of the filter modification models have been made and are in
analytical for physical testing. Subjective evaluation of the models has
been initiated. Evaluations continued with alkaline treatment of filler and
filters in an effort to increase overall response of ART cigarette smoke.

The large-scale portion of the nicotine add-back study is complete.
The nicotine add-back for small-scale has been rescheduled for early
September.

Subjective screening has been completed of 24% RL's (Marlboro
configuration) from Park 500 with 2% and 4‘ Bermuda stem. The 4% Level
again was clearly different. Evaluation of combinations of these RL's with
test RCB's (11% and 16% Bermuda stem) at normal levels in Marlboro are in
progress to select models for POI. tests. Pilot as tests are in progress on
both MPC and citric acid post-ART stem based on encouraging subjective
results with NH on and Ca(0m2 treatments. Analytical and subjective tests
are in progress to establish specifications for Louisville as production
trials.

Subject: 'Ilraficant Hearing on General Services Administration Policy on Smoking
in Federal! Buildings

F’er your request, Ii have become involved in preparations for next Tuesday’s
oversight hearing before the Public Buildings and Grounds Subcommittee
(Public Works Full Committee), chaired by Rep. Jim Traﬁcant (D-OH)1. After
learning of the hearing late yesterday afternoon, I have canvassed the
“friendly” Member staffs of the Subcommittee and the Tobacco Institute as to
the current situation. My findings, initial actions, and1 future considerations

are: set forth below.

Background

Apparently, Chairman Traﬁcant indicated his intention to conduct a
hearing on the GSA’s regulations regarding smoking in federall buildings at
an organizational meeting of the Subcommittee several weeks ago. This item
was one of ﬁfteen items discussed and no particular emphasis or priority
was given to the tobacco issue at that time.

Republican sources believe that Traficant has chosen to hold? this hearing
now because the federal building smoking policy has become a “high profile”
issue due to: theactions of Rep. Durbin (D—IL). Holding the hearing now
would also be in accord with the House Democratic leadership request that
House Committee and Subcommittee Chairmen “get busy” to show action.
Moreover, these sources see some reason to believe that there may be a
Traﬁcant/Durbin “conspiracy” atwork. Apparently, Traficant‘has been:
“spending a lot of time” in the Appropriations Committee on specific District
projects, which could indicate some type of a trade off between Traflcant and
Durbin (who chairs the House Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee);

The Hearing N
c.
The plans are for Tuesday to be an Oversight hearing on the GSA. There arw
three items slated to be addressed: a
' The GSA smoking policy in federal buildings. 3
‘ The GSA plans for child care facilitiesin all federal buildings. 0')
° The GSA use of alternative fuelsin all federally leased or owned CD
automobiles. \I

FROM: Claire Carcich
SUBJECT: Minnesota Disclosure Statute

This memorandum summarizes the existing Minnesota disclosure statute
(Minn. Stat. Chapter 461 Section 461.17) relating to cigarettes.

I Each manufacturer of cigarette products sold in Minnesota shall provide
the Commissioner of Health (”Commissioner”) with an annual report, in a
form and at a time specified by the Commissioner, identifying for each
brand any of the following substances present in detectable levels in the

product in its unburned and burned state:

ammonia or any compound of ammonia;
arsenic;

cadmium;

I Tobacco Substance Reporting Forms (”Form”) were sent to the tobacco
companies (See attached letter dated October 1998 and enclosed form)
indicating that the completed forms must be returned to the Minnesota

Department of Health (”Department”) by February 15, 1999. The
Department requests voluntary submission of the protocol used for testing.

0 The Minnesota Disclosure statute expressly states that the Form is not a
rule1 for purposes of the Administrative Procedure Act (Minn. Stat. Chapter
14, including section 14.386).

I Reports filed are public data. [Note Under the Minnesota Government
Data Practices Act, trade secret information2 collected by a state agency is

We believe our laboratory research can support the SuperSlims
advertising claim of 70& less smoke from the lit and of the cigarette as
compared to the leading 100 mm brand, and 60‘ less smoke from the lit and as
compared to Capri.

This research utilizes an instrument which measures the amount
(intensity) of light which passes through the smoke plume of eight
cigarettes under laboratory conditions. The light source is a Helium-Neon

Laser operating at a wave length of 543.5 nanometers.

The measured value for the Virginia Slims SuperSlims cigarette used in

the advertising photography is equivalent to the measured value expected to:
the commercially manufactured product.

Two product tests have recently been completed pairing each Olive
prototype with Caster.

The objective of these studies are as follows:

1{ To measure the acceptability of the Olive prototype to the

Japanese smoke: in general and to the Caster smoker in
particular.

2. To evaluate the smoking choreoterietics of these prototypes as
compared to Caster for future product development.

This report addresses the results of Test 2 -- Olive II vs. Center.
The results of Test 1 -- Olive I vs. Caster have been released under
separate cover.

Olive II was tested among two groups, Caster smokers and non-Caster
smokers, the latter constituting a general representation of the
Japanese smoker market.

Qaljfomia has initially rejected the production of a heat transfer stamp; PM USA
will do everything possible to expedite development of the stamp, but an agreement
has not yet been reached. Until then, the water applied stamp must be used. The
state currently has 3mm water based stamps on hand.

Hawaii is a no tax-stamp state.

Hand Skimping Allowanoo

The current handstamping allowance is $.20 per carton on an ongoing basis. It has
come to Brand’ 3 attention that this allowance is inadequate to cover the necessary
time and labor involved in handstamping with a water based stamp.

The new handstamping allowance for water based stamps only will be $.25 per
carton, from Nov. 15 — Dec. 31, 1992. At that date, Brand will re—evaluate the need

for this allowance based on the availability of a heat applied stamp.

Wholesalolﬂog'l Allowanooa

To ensure proper sell-in, both wholesale and retail allowances have been further
extended. Wholesale allowances are extended to Nov, 2 Z, 1222. Retail allowances

PM dAsE‘a41 DIylSION III

Craig in U.S. Patent 2,583,548 teaches the treatment of cellulosic pulp
containing 1% to 6% of fibers with an excessive amount (10%) of a calcium
chloride solution which gives a salt to fiber dry weight ratio from 1.67
to 10; causing the pulp containing the calcium chloride to a prolonged
mechanical,treatment, and then adding a soluble salt such as sodium
carbdnate to react with the calcium chloride to form a precipitated
calcium campound pigment.

Our‘case (Serial No. 519,619) differs from that of Craig in that the

cellulosic pulp is caused to swell and hydrate by chemical means by react-

ing the cellulosic pulp with the ammonium and/or alkali metal hydroxides
which in addition force the polyvalent metal ions to be fixed in the

cellulosic matrix either as a water insoluble precipitate or as a ”salt"
of the cellulosic matrix. Both of these mechanisms of precipitating or
fixing metalic ions uniformly in the cellulosic matrix are probably

responsible for altering the combustion of the cellulosic substrate and

for improving the subjective character of smoke. The required amounts

of precipitated or fixed metal ions needed to achieve this effect is
significantly lower than that practiced by Craig for a different purpose
(in our case the ratio of salt to cellulosic material is less than 0.4).

Briskin, et. al., (U.S. Patent 3,640,285) deals with the treatment of
cigarette paper containing calcium or magnesium or strontium or barium
oxalate, pivalate, tannate. This paper could be produced by treating an
existing cigarette paper containing calcium carbonate with oxalic acid or
pivalic or tannic, or by adding the desired salt to the cellulosic pulp
used in the original formation of the paper web (see column 2 lines 65-69).

In this case, Briskin teaches the selection of one salt over another for

a cigarette paper and his method of treatment in no way teaches or makes
obvious the treatment of cellulosic material with hydroxides of ammonium
and/or alkalies to uniformly fix a polyvalent metal cation to the cellulo—
sic matrix. In column 2 lines 37-38 "The oxalic acid solution operates to
convert calcium carbonate to insoluble calcium oxalate." We do not see any

relation in this statement to those of ours since Briskin converts one
insoluble salt, CaCO3, to another insoluble salt, calcium oxalate, and

according to his earlier statement, column 2 lines 65-69 it does not make a
difference whether the oxalate is added to the paper at the pulping section
in place of calcium carbonate or is formed by treating the paper containing

the carbonate with oxalic acid. As a result our invention is in no way

similar or obvious from the Briskin teachings. Also, it is claimed in Claim

1 that one of the anions that could be used to form the calcium salt is
“lactic acid" which forms calcium lactate with a very good solubility iﬂ_
water! '

SUBJECT: PROPOSED STUDIES UN THE EFFECTS OF CYCLDBEXTRINS UPDN THE COMPOSITION
OF TDBQCCD SMOKE

INTRODUCTION:

This proposal outlines a research project focused on the use of cyclodextrins as
a filtering device for benzoEaprrene in cigarette smoke.

In brief, cyclodextrins (CyD) are carbohydrates formed by the enzymatic
degradation of starch. The majority of Cyﬂ‘s used are alpha, beta and gamma
Cyﬂ’s are cyclic in which six, seven and eight glucose molecules, respectively,
are linked in a large ring by 1,4 glucoside linkages. This results in a rigid,
conical molecular structure with a hollow interior. The dimension of the
interior ranges from 5.7 to 9.5 A in diameter depending upon the number of
glucose units and is c 7.8 9 deep. The interior of this cavity is relatively
hydrophobic while the erior of the cavity is hydrophobic. These properties
of the CyD allow the formation of stable CyU complexes with other molecules.(1)

  
 

Today cyclodextrins are widely used in foods, cosmetics and toiletries due to
their ability to molecularly encapsulate flavors and fragrances. It is this
ability that makes CyU’s attractive for use in cigarettes. In fact, the
possible uses of cyclodextrins in cigarette filters has not gone unnoticed.
Several studies on the application of cyclodextrins to stabilize cigarette
flavors have been reported: Rob et al. from Philip Morris examined the
stabili ion of menthol, furan, anethole, linalool, geraniol, cineol,
citronellal, phenylethyl alcohol, coumarin and cinnamaldehyde.(2) From this
work several patents were obtained.(3,4,5) In addition to these studies
numerous other people outside of the tobacco industry have investigated CyD
complexes of materials common to both their interests and cigarettes.(b)
Lorillard studies conducted by P. Schickedantz have addressed the use CyD’s for
flavor stabilization and delivery. He erlored the complexation of citral and
orange oil with betaocyclodextrin.(7,8).

  

 

A secon- area of CyU research has involved the incorporation of Cyﬂ’s
cigarette filters for the purpose of smoke filtration. It :as been a,
the addition of CyD’s to the filter reduces nicotine and tar deliver ‘1
{DUt impairing the aroma and flavor of the cigarette.(9,10) Most patents ‘2
in this aspect of CyD use have focused on the abilities of _yE’ ’o :3
- and hi otine. With Lorillard’s emphasis on c ting a safer d5
cigaret , cyclodextrins appear to offer a great potenti for adsorbing not ‘3
only tar and nicotine but other biologically active components found in GD
cigarette mohe. One cat“gory of components of interest include the PQH’s. It
has been demonstrated t at CyD’s form inclusion complexes with

Remember a long time ago when I was going to send this to you? i0 and behold, here it
is,

I think you’ll see some very interesting information in here. I found it fascinating and the
comparisons are evident.

Of particular note is the fact that the information was compiled from the Anti-Saloon
League Museum right here in Westerville -- a suburb of Columbus. Also, Oberlin College

in northern Ohio maintains a comprehensive collection of historical documents related to
the Women’s Chirstian Temperance Union.

As I mentioned, David Laufer and Chan had discussed this angle for possible media
activity a while back and that’s when Jim Underwood (who works for us as a researcher

for projects) initially began his search.

Please review and let me know your thoughts. I still think this has excellent story

SUBJECT: A Review on the Study of Reducing MutageniCLty of Tats
Generated from Various Materials " '

 

Since July 25, we have performed more than 100 experiments. A
summary of the results is attached in Appendix A. We found that
there are two ways to reduce the mutagenic1ty of tar generated
either from pyrolysis or smoking: By lowering the pyrolysis/—
~smokinq temperature or by diluting highly mutagenic tar with low
mutagenic tar.

-,-,m-,-.-—-, A

The progress of our study can be divided into two stages. The

first stage is a series of preliminary tests which were carried

out in the experiments from run #1 to run #16. We used #1580
tobacco (l) as the testing sample and pyrolyzed it at various
temperatures and flow rates. The Ames test was used to detect

ha the mutagenic activity of tar. This set of data, as discussed in F
the previous report (2), shOWS that the mutagenicity of tar
increases with the increase of pyrolysis temperature (Figure 1).
It also shows that the flow rate has a certain degree of effect
on the mutagenicity of tar due to the fact that the compound(s)

responsible for the activity is(are) low volatile (Figure 2).

 

The next stage is a series of screening tests of some basic
materials and the mixtures of these materials with other additives.
The results of those basic materials are listed in Table 1. The
relative values used in this table are based on the value of

91580 tobacco, which is assigned as 100. The reason to use a
relative value is that, from time to time, the reproducibility of
the experiments is not quite good probably due to the biological
uncertainty as shown in Appendix A, column 9. #1580 is thus used
as an internal reference.

From Table 1, we found that the tar from Whatman #42 filter paper
(W42), i.e., pure alpha—cellulose, has virtually no mutagenic
activity while the tar from Burley stems (BYST) has very high
activity, about 70% higher than that of the #1580 tobacco. If

MEMORANDUM

MAR 1 1 1991

TO: Dr. James F. Glenn CC: HCM
RFG

FROM: Hilda and Leonard Zahn

SUBJECT: International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and
Climate, Toronto, Canada, July 29—Aug 3, 1991

A speaker at the opening session said that in seeking to con-
serve energy in recent years, "we have created a monster." The
monster has several faces: medical problems, building problems
(which have expanded beyond the "sick building syndrome" of com-
mercial buildings to include residential homes and even apart—
ments), and social, economic and political problems.

Other aspects are involved as well. Research into indoor air
quality (IAQ) has grown at a tremendous rate since the first in-
ternational meeting on the subject was held in 1978. Until re-
cently, scientific attention had been focused chiefly on outdoor
air quality;~now, however, there is a new science -- indoor air
chemistry -- with more funds and more investigators, especially
in the industrialized nations. There also is a surprising amount
of work going on in less-developed countries, much of it in col-
laboration with western researchers.

There is more concern about IAQ because most people spend
about 80-90% of their time indoors during their lives, and tight—
ened structures generate and retain more harmful or potentially
harmful organisms, agents, gases, odors, and particulates. The
list contains hundreds of items, some of them produced naturally
by the human organism.

The overall situation is compounded by the fact that the com-
plex actions of-many indoor substances as well as the interac-
tions between them are presently little understood. The immense
amount of variability of human reactions to agents indoor adds to
the complexity of trying to determine what factor (5) may create
a risk and who is at risk upon exposure.

Scientists are not always helpful with data that often seem to
be a bit far out. For example, taking a shower subjects everyone
to inhalation or dermal absorption of a number of volatile organ-
ic compounds (VOC) in the water. Many of these chemicals have
been shown to be harmful to health.

It seems valid to say that people in the developed countries
generally are not adversely affected by all the putatively harm—
ful substances they encounter every day while they are indoors.

It is equally valid to say that nobody really can say what are CD

the long—term effects of many of the things floating in the in- ag

OVERVIEW

‘Ihe Marlboro Red 85mm soft pack smokers significantly preferred (57%/43%)
their own brand to Winston Red 85mm soft pack. Qualitatively, Marlboro was
perceived to have a "milder taste", "easier draw", to be "less harsh",
"cooler smoking" and "not have a dry taste in the mrth". A large
percentage of these smokers preferred Marlboro because they were milder and
not as harsh.

'Ihe Winston Red 85mm soft pack smokers significantly preferred (56%/44%)
their own brand to Marlboro Red 85mm soft pack. Qualitatively, Winston was
perceived to be "more satisfying". Marlboro was perceived to be "milder
tasting".

SUBJECT: Survey for Airborne Friable Materials in the Greensboro
' Accounting Department ‘ , -.. . ;;€

 

The discovery of suspect whitish particles on the desk of

5. 7 Mr. Wayne Oakes led to an airborne survey of the office followed

(H? by qualitative microscopic analysis of the filter membrane. A

’- personal sampling pump was calibrated with an in-line Millipore

AA 0.8 micron filter at a flow rate of 2 liters per minute. An
eight-hour sample was taken on October 28, 1986 as per NIOSH “--
asbestos method &CAM239. The absolute sensitivity of the method
was 0.1 fiber/cm of ir. The present permissible exposure limit
(PEL) is 0.2 fiber/cm of air. Upon completion of the survey,

the filter cassette was sealed, labelled and transferred to the
Analytical Development section for qualitative microscopic

- analysis. '

A portion of the membrane filter was mounted and analyzed by an
151 Super III Scanning Electron Microscope for the physical
appearance of the trapped particulates (1). No asbestiform
fibrous materials were found. Cellulosic paper particles, as
noted in Figures 1 and 2, and paper filler particles noted in
Figures 3 and 4 were the predominant species. These inert j
materials, which are found in office environments, are considered .g-
nuisance dusts and constitute no health hazard. i

Line III Evaporators - Soaking for Cleaning

In reference to your question about soaking the evaporators as an
alternative means of cleaning, I contacted Sirrine to see if the
structural steel was designed to support this type of load.

The attached letter from Jeffrey Reeves of Sirrine confirms that the
structural steel will support the flooded weight of all four evaporators.

Since Mr. Reeves left open the question on the support lugs for the
evaporator, I contacted Chemetron. Mr. Mike Martin of the Engineering
Department at Chemetron told me by phone on November 1, 1988, that all
evaporators they build are designed to be flooded and the support lugs are
designed to handle this type of load. He said that soaking is a common
practice with many of their evaporator customers. .He cautioned us not to
run the main drive on the rotor as this would do damage to the unit. He
mentioned that some users do have a "clean out drive" that turns the rotor
very, very slowly to help agitate the soaking solution. He also said to
not put any extra pressure on the unit while soaking (i.e. keep vent.
valves open so pressure cannot build up).

My recommendation based on the above is to only soak 1 evaporator at
a time and ensure that the main rotor drive is locked out prior to filling
the evaporator. Pulling the cover plate off the top of the mist
eliminator and removing the eliminator screen will provide both a vent
Opening and an inspection port to allow your operator to see when the
evaporator is full of water. With this cover off, you could fill the
evaporator with process hot water and crack open the jacket steam just a
little (5 PSIG or less) to keep the water hot while the unit is soaking.

I understand you have a procedure being written for this operation
which I will be reviewing with you prior to using the soaking method for
cleaning.

If you have any questions, please contact me.

Single-Blade Carbon Heater Evaluation:

Evaluation has begun of the ﬁrst 4‘-blade constant contact pressure ﬁxture prototype
from Laser Mechanical. A manual switch has been installed for heater switching. This ﬁrst
prototype ﬁxture was manufactured from MACOR. A second PEEK ﬁxture is expected tomorrow.
If prototype evaluations are successful, ﬁve more PEEK ﬁxtureswill befabricated.

Tobacco Substrate Studies:

Bright and burley dust samples are being separated by mesh size (100 to <270‘ mesh).
These samples will be used to prepare cast sheets to detemiine the effect of particle size
on sheet integrity and subjective character.

IR camera studies of glassy carbon heaters, coated with cast tobacco sheet using
Konjac ﬂour as the adhesive, demonstrated that adhesion was maintained at heater
temperatures up to 409 ° C. Continued modiﬁcations are being made to the binder system to
increase the temperature threshold for adhesion failure. Samples of Konjac ﬂour have been
submitted to Dr. Carchman for pyrolysis GC/MS analysis (300, 600 and 900 ° C).

MT Orientall strip has been cut and adhered to carbonr heater strips for baseline
subjective evaluation. Two different high ﬂavor, highr alkaloid blend dusts (ca. 200 mesh)
have been received from Flavor Development. These samples will be sieved to separate into
discreet me sh sizes for cast sheet preparation and subjective screening.

Miscellaneous:

The Karl Fischer titrator has been set up and is operational, permitting accurate
moisture determination on heaters, cast sheets and tobacco dust samples.

Assistance was provided to the Materials group to coat screen-printed ceramic heater
prototypes with tobacco sheet for thermal evaluation. A calcium crosslinked Konjac ﬂour
adhesive system resisted sheet/heater delamination at temperatures >400 ° C‘ as measured by
thermocouple (estimated >450 ° C actual). Further studies will be conducted to determine the
surface properties of the screen-printed heaters.

A meeting was held with Bill Bell, Marshall Garrett and Bob Hale of Flavor Development
to begin consideration of ﬂavor system development for the RTX prototype. Based on their
initial subjective evaluation of prototypes containing Burley and Flue-Cured sheets, Belll
and Garrett are selecting ﬂavor ingredients for subjective screenings beginning next week.

From: . Myron Johnston ,
Subject: . Differences between smokers of Marlboro Lights and Winston Lights

As Peggy Martin noted in her memo on this subject, the major difference

between smokers of Marlboro Lights and Winston Lights is their age. Most of
the socio—economic differences observed are what one would expect on the basis
of the different age distributions. As she also mentioned, the National POL
Panel, on which those data are based, is short of young smokers and blacks,
because of the difficulty in recruiting them and keeping them on the panel, and
is heavily weighted with women. (when we select panelists for a product test
we select based on the true distribution of smokers of the brand of interest,
as you know.) Because the Panel is not truly representative of the market, I
looked at the data from the Tracking Study.

Percent who smoke Marlboro Lights and Winston Lights by age

The top panel of Figure 1 shows the percent of all smokers who smoke a Marlboro
Light or Winston Light (King or 100), by age. Winston Lights Kings has its
highest market penetration among smokers 35 to 44 years old and Winston Lights
1005, like 100mm brands generally, skews toward an older group. By contrast,
Marlboro Lights Kings has its greatest appeal to the youngest smokers. As in
the case of Winston, the 100mm version skews toward somewhat older ages then
the King, but unlike Winston Lights 1005, Marlboro Lights 100 still has its
highest market penetration among the youngest smokersl

The bottom panel of Figure 1 shows the percent of smokers who smoke the
different packings of Marlboro Lights, by age. In both cases the box packings
skew more toward young smokers than the soft packs. This is true of virtually
every brand that is available in both box and soft pack.

Historical patterns of smoking of Marlboro Red and Marlboro Lights

Marlboro Lights has not always skewed so heavily to the young smokers. Until
the early 19805 the growth of Marlboro Lights was largely a result of people
switching out of Marlboro Red, and its smokers were not as young as smokers of
Marlboro Red. Since then it has become increasingly an entry brand. Figure 2
shows the percent of smokers, by age, who smoked Marlboro Red and Marlboro
Lights (Kings or 1005) for the years 1979 to 1987.

Note that after several years during which both Marlboro Red and Marlboro

Suuecu - Charcoal Filter Cigaret ‘ [835— ajﬁkd

A major breakthrough in cigaret flavoring would be the
development of a charcoal ﬁiltered cigaret which cannot be
differentiatedifrom one which contains no charcoal in the
filter. I feel this deserves serious consideration as it
may be the only way by which we can save one of our brands.

Hurst, as requested in your June 18 memorandum, the following
is a listing of GASP and related organizations in Region IV.

IOWA:

At this time, Iowa does not have a GASP organization in force.
The American Lung Association of Iowa, through its Des Moines
office, refers any calls they receive regarding GASP or ANSR
(Association for Nonsmokers Rights) to the GASP office in
Colorado or to ANSR in Minnesota.

MINNESOTA:

Currently, there is not a GASP organization in the state of
Minnesota. However, there is an active chapter of ANSR which has
its only statewide office in Minneapolis.

membership. The American Lung Association of Nebraska refers
calls to the GASP office in Colorado.

NORTH DAKOTA:

The GASP organization in North Dakota currently meets monthly in
the American Lung Association of North Dakota office in Bismarck.
Although the only GASP chapter is in Bismarck, they have a

SUBJECT: PMO Aerosolization

Formulations have been prepared with the object of
obtaining a PMO aerosol which would enable human inhalation

of about 30 mg of PMO over a period of a few minutes to a
few hours.

Test formulations were dispensed using a Devilbis Model
# 40 hand-bulb nebulizer operated either by squeezing or by
low pressure laboratory air after removing the bulb. The

amount of liquid dispensed, found by weight loss after a
given number of squeezes, was as follows:

mg/sgueeze
Water 2.7
lzl propylene glycol—water (w/w) 2.0
PMO saturated 4:1 propylene glycol—water (w/w) 0.93
PMO saturated propylene glycol 0.4

The variability in delivery is undoubtedly due either
to evaporation, in the case of water, or weight gain of water
by hydroscopic propylene glycol. The true delivery is
probably about 1 mg/squeeze as was obtained for the 4:1

propylene glycol-water mixture which should be nearly in
equilibrium with air at 35% humidity.

The room temperature solubility (@ 24°C) of PMO was found

to be 123 mg/g in propylene glycol and 65 mg/g in 4:1 propylene

glycol-water (w/w). (For practical purposes PMO is insoluble
in water or glycerine.)

Using 1 mg of solution/squeeze as the delivery, 240
squeezes would be required to deliver 30 mg of PMO from PMO

saturated propylene glycol and 460 squeezes for PMO saturated
4:1 propylene glycol-water.

The nebulizer filled with PMO saturated 4:1 propylene

glycol-water was operated using the laboratory air supply. A
rotometer in the air line read 15 scfh at 5 psi. The weight

PARTICIPATION IN LEAP MEETINGS

This requests your assistance in scheduling our participation
in the Region LEAP meetings. I believe that you’ ve heard
about these sessions, perhaps referred to as PECOS training.
Sales has invited us, as well as Marketing Services and Trade
Marketing, to participate with them in these meetings. This
will give us an opportunity to develop better working
relationships with these people that are so critical to our
business.

The objective is to have the Brand Group and their respective
Marketing Services counterparts participate in the regional
meeting where their businesses are strongest. The schedule
of meetings are listed below:

Event For Dates Locations Hotel

West 3/30 — 4/1 Phoenix, AZ Hyatt Regency at
Region 5 Civic Plaza
Midwest 4/6—8 Phoenix, AZ Omni Adams Hotel
Region 4

Northwest 6/1-3 Nashville, TN Opryland Hotel
Region 1

Southwest 6/29 - 7/1 Nashville, TN Opryland Hotel
Region 2

It would make most sense to me if Virginia Slims would be at
the Southeast meeting, Parliament and Merit to be at the
Northeast meeting and Benson & Hedges to be either at the
West or Midwest (the West maybe on too-short timing). Please
confirm with Denise whether you are available for the
appropriate dates. Additionally, Arthur and Susan need to
let me know which dates they are available.

FROM: Laurie Moroz

RE: Definition of Threshold Perception Index

.-—--—--—————-—-.-.--_————.-.----—_—-—--.u——-—————.—------—-----—-——-——-—---——-—-

The Fhreshold Perception Index is an expression of the probable stopping
power of an outdoor ad. It is a measurement of the average number of elements
correctly identified by respondents after viewing the ad at the threshold
exposure (which varies from .2 to .8 seconds). The Index is computed as follows:
Every element recalled by every respondent is assigned one "point;" in addition,
one point eachiis given for correct brand name and product identification.

All respondents' points are then accumulated, averaged, and expressed as a

percentage. (Elements of an ad consist of headline words or phrases, as well
as pictorial elements.)

For example, if a respondent, after threshold exposure, claims to have seen
"a pack of True cigarettes and a 5," his_answer constitutes five points - one
point each for the pack, the word‘”True”, and the "5“, and one point eachifor
correctly identifying brand and product. If the average number of elements re-

called by respondents for that ad was 4.86, the Threshold Perception Index would
be 486%.

The norm of 400% was developed throughicorrelation of Communicus' pre-testing

andlpost—test data. (Post-testin Testimates the number of people who have noticed
an outdoor ad in the marketplace.? 'An ad which earns a Threshold Percention

.Index of 400% or more is likely to perform well in Conmunicus' post-testing,

ie. is likely to be above average in attracting attention under actual viewing
conditions, “

It is theoretically possible for an ad tolreceive no correct brandlidenti-
fication, but still have a Threshold Perception Index of 400% or more. This is

unﬂikely since recognition of the brand name is usually worth two "points" in
"the Index. However, if such a situation did occur, it would probably meanithat

the ad had excellent stopping power, but that it attracted attention with strong,
creative elements which had little or nothing to do with the brand itself.

It is important to remember that the Threshold Perception Index is merely

suggestive of actual performance and must always be evaluated within the context
of all findings from the same test.

1. LOW TAR FILLER LTF‘
A. Chemical Evaluation

1. The LTF-IIDF formulation whose whole smoke conden-
sate compared favorably to that of IIA has been modified further
at the request of the Chemical Research Group (6908). One of

these modifications was that of IIJF which is a similar material
to IIDF but without humectant.

The whole smoke condensate of IIJF was then compared
to that of IIDF; and based on the correlation of Grimmer
fractions 11, III and IV with activity, the order of relative
predicted activity is LTF-IIJF > LTF-IIDF. The absolute activity,
however, is predicted to be low for both types since the yield
of fraction II is greater than 90% in both cases.

2. It was decided to test LTF-IIJF further and the
production of 15,000 pounds of this material is scheduled to
begin at the BL Pilot Plant on September 22.

B. Smoking Evaluations

l. A range of low tar fiblerS‘(LTF-IIDF, IIEF, IIJF
and‘IIICF) possessing similar subjective characteristics, varying
tar deliveries, and significantly lower C0 values (7-9‘mg/cigt)
were developed and screened.

2. The blend and flavor development studies were
continued‘with 50 and 75% LTF-IIDF in the blend.

3. The use of a mixture of alkaline earth metal salts
of the low molecular weight organic acids (Cl-Clp) with LTF-IIDF
formulation produced an acceptable mainstream/sidestream smoke
at the 50 and 75% levels.

4. The role of sheet foaming on tar and CO deliveries
is now being investigated with foamed/unfoamed LTF-IID and IIIB.

SUBJECT: EVALUATION OF KABAT SAMPLING/ANALYSIS TEST AT LPF

Objectives;

1.

Determine the amount of variation in the Kabat concentration (PPM) within
a hogshead of strip.

Determine the amount of variation in the Kabat application and process
systems at the Leaf Processing Facility (LPF).

Determine the average difference between Kabat (methoprene) results

generated at Universal Leaf Tobacco Company (ULT) using the CC method and
results generated at PM using‘the HPEC method.

Conclusions:

1.

The average amount of variation in the Kabat concentration for the
fifteen (15) hogsheads which were sampled‘during the test was 1.1 PPM.
The "projected" average variation in the fourteen (14) hogsheads which
were not sampled was 1.3 PPM. Based on a 95% confidence interval of the
overall average variation, the Kabat concentration within an individual
hogshead can vary by i 2.4 PPM around the average value.

The Kabat flow for each system was set at a rate which was calculated to
achieve a projected‘Kabat value of 7.5 PPM at a constant rate of tobacco
throughput. The variation in each Kabat system at LPF was determined on

a 95% confidence interval. The data for each of the systems is as
follows:

 

S stem er# E_ _g_ Projected Kzlifference §§_ 953 C,I,
1 49 5.7‘ 7.5 - 1.8 1.3 i 2.6
2 49 6.0 7.5 - 1.5 1.3 i 2.7
3 49 6.2 7.5 - 1.3 2.2 i 4.3

All parameters were held as steady as possible during the tests which
were conducted, therefore the estimates of variation for each system are
probably the best that can be achieved at this time. Under normal
operating conditions, the variation would probably be greater.

Subject: Weekly Summary - Paper Prod. Development - Feb. 27 - March 10, 1995

§A11 Prod. Launch - Japan (IPP§):

Attended a meeting to plan the next steps for moving into production of Virginia
Slims Special Lights, and to prepare for Danchi testing of menthol prototypes.

Discussed incoming material testing for paper composition with QSE personnel,
who will look into potential differences in analytical methodology (CaCOS and MKP by
X—ray) between the 43g/m2 and the current Superslims production 53 g/m2 paper.

Sue Tafur and i also met with QSE personnel to discuss conventional QA
testing of shipments of low sidestream paper with experimental codes 10-994A, 10-
995A and 10-996A. it was decided that it would be sufficient to test only every fourth
pallet for Coresta, CaCOS and MKP. initially, the Coresta will be measured at Ft&D
while the possibility of getting a proper 10 cm2 external clamp for Cabarrus is pursued.

Received samples from Roger Slagle for investigation of competitor (RJR)
cigarettes in white packs. A testing plan was developed with Liz Chambers, and
samples were distributed to PTL and General Analytical.

4Agg Support to Marketing/Market Research:

Supplied bobbins of 53 g/m2, 9.5 Coresta low sidestream paper for additional
1mg prototype production in Semiworks and sent for larger quantities of paper from the

pallet we had arranged for K-C to ship to the warehouse.

Requested cigarettes for 8-port testing and prepared the samples for
conditioning. Freddie Ford resmoked three of the earlier models after appropriate
aging (>1 week) of the cigarettes. The sidestream visibility reduction improved to ~44%
versus the 3 day aging average of ~37%. The three models we resmoked were the

ones that had been selected as primary candidates.

Chemical and SalmaﬁeZZa/Microsome Differentiation of Elmenhorst
Cold Trapped and Impaction Trapped WSCs from X6D3NX (bright + NaNOs)

SUMMARY

Chemical and Salmonella/microsome assay data on NSC from a
high nitrate cigarette (XBDBNX; bright + 6.7% NaN03) suggest that
there are significant differences between Elmenhorst cold trapped
(ECT) and'impaction trapped (IT) WSCs from this cigarette.
Considering our data and some literature data as well, we suggest
that additional biological evaluation(s) be conducted on‘a ciga-
rette containing a high level of filler nitrate (e. g.,.added

NaN03) using WSCs prepared by both IT and ECT procedures.
INTRODUCTION '

Interest in nitrate addition to tobacco filler has been
stimulated by reports of decreased in viva activity of NSCs from
such cigarettes. , The addition of nitrate to filler has been 7
reported to affect both WSC composition and cigarette delivery.
Among the effects reported are reductions in puff count; TPM,
nicotine, and polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) level.2

However, nitrate addition also leads to largeeincreases in

the levels of many smoke components: nitroalkanes;3—nitrobenzenes;“

and hitrosamines. The reason for these increases presumably is

that the oxides of nitrogen (NOX) produced on smoking are reactive
with many components in smoke. . . ,

1

_ This NDX reactivity has also been demonstrated to lead to :
aging artifacts (methyl nitrite) in the gas phase from high nitrate
cigarettes.6 There is also a report that the observed decreased

catechol level in ECT NSC from high nitrate cigarettes is due to 3
artifactual formation of 4-nitrocatechol in the cold traps.7 l

Other studies of nitrophenols in smoke question the artifactual
formation of these compounds.8

AThe chemical differences described above are differences

Subject: .Examination of Centrifuged Boehmite

Two samples of Boehmite, precipitated sol-gel, batch 001, were
received. One of the samples, labelled product, had been centrifuged, dried
and ground. The other sample was the feed sol—gel prior to centrifugation.

Both samples were mounted on carbon stubbs with carbon paint and

examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and backseatter electron
microscopy.

The purpose of this examination was to determine if any metal flakes
from the stainless steel centrifuge vessel were present within the product.
Backscatter SEM was used to locate these since it affords the ability to
selectively view differences in atomic number elements within a sample.

This is demonstrated by Figure l where a small piece of a stainless steel
razor blade was examined to serve as a control.

The feed sol-gel sample examined showed no metal (Figures 2—3). Energy
dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS) was then used on the product to
determine if there was a high concentration of metals present. Al, the

constituent of the sol-gel, was the only element detected (Figure 4).

The product was then subjected to backscatter SEM. No metal flakes
were noted within the sample examined (Figures 5-8).

'———————————nr—wmm———~-—_———-———~——————_———--mu~—_--—————~-—————u——

This will summarize some thoughts coming out of yesterday‘s‘
sessions, and near term next steps.

These excellent focus groups will undoubtedly give us further
important direction. However, the major benefit for me was

their overall positioning guidance — what to communicate and
‘f (especially) what not to communicate.

 

We are moving very, very fast. And as we move forward over
the next several months we will all stay open to modifying
these early positioning thoughts. However, for now this

positioning gives us the necessary focus against which to
make changes.

Positioning Thoughts

What Helps — 1. Every group has voiced surprise, ”shock"
at how good the product tastes. Of course we‘ll make final

determinations and modifications based on product testing.
But this reaction is sure nice to see.

2. Thirty cigarettes (10 extra, pack and a half) is very
positive to many respondents. thile taste is important

("ten extra what"), this added quantity is our uniqueness,
and will be very important to trial.

3. Good taste and low tar is an important, unsatisfied
need for many smokers. Relative to Carolina 30's, we

particularly saw this in the second session yesterday.

4. Although not explicitly probed, the brand name
Carolina 30's seems to work well. I believe it brings

assurance, credibility and good taste overtones to this
new brand.

-S/M Assay - DBC Burley(BU) Control y§_DBC‘BU Treated

 

Four smokings of three samples were submitted by you for testing in the
S/M assay (h). The objective of this study was to determine if the enzymatic
treatment of tobacco by Genecor to remove insoluble proteins would lbwer the

S/M activity. For this experiment, DBC BUl(control) was treated with Pronase®

and washed, also BU was sham treated; i.e., washed only. IT 6565 from the
tour smokings of these handmade cigarettes were tested in strain TA98+S9 (Z).

 

The preparationlof the CSCs 010 mg/ml) was carried out by Charge No. 6908
personnel (3). The CSCs were storedlat -80°C until tested. All of the CSCs
were tested randomly at doses of 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, and 0.20‘mg/plate accordﬁng
to the standard test procedures 04).

All of the control data (see addendum) were within normal ranges except
for 2AA whnch was slightly lower than normal. Eachltest sample demonstratedla
dose-response and produced a response that was 2X background.

Table 1 illustrates the specific activity (S.A.) of the four smokings and
also the analysis of variance (performed using:"Minitab"). At the p>0.05
’level of signnﬁicance, the S.A.s of both the treated and sham treated samples
were lower than the BBC BU control. While this result impttes that the S/M
activity can be lowered by just sham treatment or washing the tobacco, Table 1
also shows a significant difference in the S.A.s of the treated and sham
treated; i.e., the S.A. of the Pronase® treated sample is lower. Since these
data indicated that enzymatic treatment of tobacco can signiﬁicantly lower S/M
activity, further studies in this area may be warranted. It would be useful
to also have complete filler analysis for these test sampbes, especially ﬁor
total N and cations; however, this data was not available ﬁor this experiment.
It is recommended that such analyses be included inlany future studies.

 

The GSCs yields (mg/Cigt)l and calculated total activities (T.A.) are
reported in Table 2. Analysis of variance was ahso‘perﬁormed for the T.A.
data. The difference in T.A. between the treatediand sham treated samples was
due to the higher S.A. of the sham treated (table 1) and not the CSC yield,
since the yield of both sets of samptes are nearly equah (table 2).

MEMORANDUM
TO: ALL EMPLOYEES
FROM: A.W. Spears
DATE: July 23, 1998
RE: Signiﬁcant Legal Developments

I am writing to inform you of two signiﬁcant developments which I believe could impact
favorably upon the company’s position in ongoing litigation concerning tobacco and health.

On July 16, the Appellate Division of the New York State Supreme Court reversed a
class certiﬁcation order entered by a trial judge, and ordered that plaintiffs’ claims be dismissed
in their entirety. The trial judge had certiﬁed a class consisting of New York residents who
purchased and smoked cigarettes since 1980. The Appeals Court ruling emphatically rejected
the certiﬁcation order on the grounds that individual issues of proof would predominate the
proceedings and that the class would be unmanageable. The Court pointed out that because the
tobacco companies have a Constitutional right to cross-examine each class member, the trial

“would take hundreds of years.”

This ruling is signiﬁcant in that it represents the ﬁrst time that a state appellate court has
rejected class certiﬁcation on these grounds and followed the logic of similar favorable rulings
by federal court judges throughout the country. We are hopeful that other state judges will be
guided by this inﬂuential court and adopt its clear and reasoned approach to class actions
pending in various state courts.

In another meaningful decision, a federal judge here in Greensboro, Judge William
Osteen, ruled that the Environmental Protection Agency’s classiﬁcation of environmental
tobacco smoke (ETS) as a “Group A carcinogen” was wrong as a matter of law and fact. Judge
Osteen found that the EPA did not follow the well—founded rules of procedure it was required to
and improperly adjusted established scientiﬁc procedures to validate the agency’s predetermined
conclusions. The Judge made it clear that had EPA followed such rules, it might have reached a

different conclusion.

This opinion is important in that it validates our long-held view that ETS has not been
scientiﬁcally proven to cause cancer or other diseases in non-smokers. We also believe that this
decision will make it more difﬁcult for states and localities to justify draconian smoking
restrictions in public places like restaurants and bars.

We are encouraged that these courts have applied the law in a fair and even-handed
manner in the face of unprecedented assaults on our business. I will continue to keep you
apprised of other such developments. ,

From: .Dick Howe

Subject: .Nicotine Overspray

Enclosed please find a draft of the Job Safe Procedure for the over—
spray of nicotine on cut filler or like material. In accordance with our
previous discussions and with your approval, we developed this procedure for
your explosion—proof room in Semiworks. We feel this offers several
advantages to the small scale room previously considered. One is the
obvious increase in safety from fire or explosion. In addition, it is more
isolated from other work and we feel the drying can be done in the same room
to avoid transporting the tobacco outside.

The installation of the spray cylinder and valving/reservoir unit in
the explosion proof room is underway. A hole will need to be drilled
through to the adjacent room (primary) to install the spray unit control
system which is not spark-proof. A window is to be added to the door of the
explosion— proof room (not to exceed 100 sq.in.) to allow visual contact
with the inside worker and the spray cylinder operation. This will allow
the backup team to be in standby mode (not "on air").

Johnny Jones and Linda Guinn of EEP have assured me that the window in
the door and the hole drilled through the wall can be properly sealed to
maintain the explosion proof integrity of the room. K.H. Cho and Mike
Penn are arranging to install a Class A, Division I (spark—proof)
cylinder rotating motor with belt drive instead of chain drive and an
airline lockout system for added safety. We simply need to ensure that the
electrical conduit used for installation meets the same criteria.

This procedure is now scheduled to use nicotine free.base dissolved
in ethanol instead of nicotine citrate. Our procedure was written to cover
both contingencies.

To the best of my knowledge this experiment is planned for August
7, 1989. We plan to spray filler with alcohol first - as a "dry run" for
our procedure and for use as a control sample for the research. Then we
intend to spray one batch of filler with nicotine at the 2.15% loading level
(filler analysis) which is designed to deliver the" middle" level in smoke
required for the research. This experiment will be conducted very slowly
with many samples taken to help define the hazards and safety precautions
necessary. Extra safety precautions will be taken during this first run
which may be deemed unneccessary upon review of the procedure and in light
of the analysis data and the experience of handling the tobacco produced.
The room may be needed all week.

The remaining three sprayings scheduled are to be done August 14, 1989
and August 15, 1989 if needed. As soon as the tobacco is properly dried and

RE: TRUE FOCUS GROUPS - FINAL REPORT — MRD #5542/884

________________ l__-_1f__________________________________________

BACKGROUNQ AND PURPOSE

A new True léWrtar line extension is scheduled for Test Market

during May, 1985. Part of the research program for this new

product consisted of a qualitative exploration of severalv

proposed advertising concepts.

The primary purpose of the qualitative sessions was to obtain

input on the strengths and weaknesses of each concept and

determine which if any, offered potential. It was also important

to understand consumers' reactions to a new True product in light _
(ii of current attitudes toward the brand. E
U l

 

MEIEQD

, A total of eighE focus group sessions were conducted in two
markets -— Manhassett, Long Island and Atlanta, Georgia. All
groups were composed of competitive smokers (10+ cigarettes per
day) between the ages 25 and 44. The structure of the groups was
consistent across both markets —— half male, half female; half
lo—tar, half lo—fi (low tar prone). "Low tar prone“ was defined

as having "top 3 box" purchase intent to try a low tar brand in
the future.

CONCLUSIOHS

Overall, the True Gold concept met with favorable reaction. The
interest for this idea was fairly equal across the major lo—fi
and low tar segments although females were certainly more
positive about it than males. (While more males were positive
than negative, favorability among this group occurred at a lower
frequency when compared to females). Males tended to see the
concept as more feminine whereas females were more likely to View

it as neutral:'.; '

g; 'Because of the many differences in creative presentation,~
. packaging, tar level and filter, True Gold was seen as having
little in common with the currently marketed True product. In

fact, many group members did not see the two as related until

Horace has asked me to send you the attached copy of the Kennedy bill\\(

as marked up yesterday, August 17, by his Subcommittee on Health and
Scientific Research.

It was unanimously approved and will go to the full committee where
its chances are equally favorable.

Note the bill number has been changed from 3115 to 3116. Eliminated
are all of those elements of Title IV dealing with smoking which would
require sequential referral to other Senate committees. These omissions
include the "toxic unit tax", the restriction of smoking in government

buildings and the "Swedish style" multiple warnings. What remains is
the deterrent of smoking among children and the section that calls for
an HEW study of tobacco smoke and additives. The section that deals

with tobacco is now Title III, beginning on page 28.

MEMORANDUM
URGENT

TO: All Vice Presidents
All Department Heads
All Records Coordinators

FROM: F. A. Burke
Vice President Law & General Counsel

DATE: May 26, 1994

RE: Retain All Documents

Under an order in litigation, the Company is required to retain literally all documents regarding certain
subjects.

Effective immediately, Brown & Williamson employees are required to retain indeﬁnitely all documents
relating to (1) the manufacturing, testing and composition of tobacco, tobacco products, paper, ﬁlter or
any other material contained in, relating to or used in the manufacture, testing and composition of tobacco
producg or (2) the nicotine content of tobacco, tobacco products tcigarettg, pipe tobacco, smoking

tobacco, smokeless tobacco, ﬁller, reconstituted tobacco, expanded tobacco, etc.) and cigarette smoke.

Please note that this requirement under the court order overrides the provisions of our Records
Management Program. One effect of overriding the Program is that the order requires us to retain
relevant c0pies and temporary documents. The other effect concerns electronic documents.
M

Under the order, the term "document" means every form of recorded information, whether handwritten
or printed, and including electronic information as follows:

videotape . . . phonograph record, tape record, mechanical or electronic sound recording
or transcript thereof, retrievable data (whether carded, taped, coded, electrostatically or
electromagnetically recorded, or otherwise), or other data compilation from which
information can be obtained, including (but not limited to) . . . computer storage tapes,
computer storage cards or discs . . . .

Thus, all such electronic information that is relevant to the subject matter is required to be retained
indeﬁnitely. If you have any questions about how to save electronic information, please call MIS.

For your information, the litigation involved is the Castano case in Louisiana. As y0u may know from
media reports, a group of plaintiff's law ﬁrms has ﬁled a complaint alleging a class action against the
industry on behalf of smokers who claim to be addicted. Plaintiffs obtained an order which froze the
companies’ documents at a time when Brown & Williamson was not a party to the case and there are
good arguments that the order does not apply to us. After careful consideration, we have decided that
the best course for the Company is to comply.

TO: Field Sales Force DATE: April 13, 1995

FROM: Craig Johnson/Senior VP, Sales
SUBJECT: A k Fir 1' th Law /3 - 72

Selling cigarettes to minors is against the law. it's that simple. While PM USA does not sell cigarettes
directly to consumers, PM USA has always advocated that retail accounts comply with the law.

One of the ways to further support the Company's commitment regarding restricting the sale of
cigarettes to minors is to reinforce this principle with our accounts and their employees. importantly,
retailers nationwide have been asking us for assistance in complying with their state laws.

As a result, we are providing you with enhanced program materials to use with your accounts.
These program materials were successfully tested in Cincinnati in the fourth quarter of 1994. Our
focus with accounts begins in June and July, with continuous program support in the balance of
1995. Program details are outlined below.

Current Situation
The law holds retailers responsible for selling tobacco products legally. Retailers that sell cigarettes

to minors may be subject to fines, a loss of their licenses and possibly even jail time.

Key Issue
How do we help to inform and educate retailers and their employees regarding their responsibilities

to enforce their state laws?

The Plan
In June and July, place the "Ask First/It's the Law" program in all workload accounts during normal

call coverage. Then continue to place materials during 1995, making this part of your in-store
mission.

Here's How it Works
. Hi i 'n
- Sell the program to all accounts as a value-added service, beginning May 30 , 1995

—Thoroughly review the program materials to ensure that retailers understand their
responsibilities.

- A copy of the Ask First/It's the Law Sell-in Story is enclosed and can be accessed via the Si
Support-File Server in the folder entitled "Ask First/It's the Law Sell-in Story."

smoking in reducing the incidence of heart attacks is
based on prospective experience in human populations.
The method by which the observed experience is used

for designing the trial, and the methodological diffi-

In his introduction,.Tavia Gordon said that the topic which
Dr. Halperin was going to discuss is "complex and messy.”

Dr. Halperin's opening statement went something like this.
"only two people in the world understand the problems of
MRFIT, and (turning to Gordon) I am not sure about you.

SAFETY — PHILIPPINES

We have received an inquiry, copy attached, from Philip Morris
Asia Region concerning the transmittal of safety information to the

La Suerte Licensee. The information to be furnished is the Material
Safety Data Sheet for flammable and combustible materials which relate
specifically to the casings and flavors supplied to La Suerte by

Philip Morris. A copy of the data sheets, as furnished by PM USA, is
also attached. \

The Material Safety Data Sheets do not fully cover the safety
aspect of the materials being handled and I suggest that La Suerte

also be provided PM USA's procedure "Safe Storage, Handling, Mixing,
and Application of Ethyl Alcohol Based Flavorings", a copy of which is
attached. If we are reluctant to issue a PM USA document to La

Suerte, perhaps the PM USA reference could be removed and the document
provided as good safety practices.

VIRGINIA SLIMS LOW SIDESTREAM

Cigarettes were made in the semiworks to Virginia Slims Lights speciﬁcations using
two of Kimberly-Clark’s high basis weight chalk papers and a binary magnesite paper tPl'l'Y).
K-C’s V3 and V51 grade papers were each sized to give respective weight additions of 10.0%
and 12.0% KH2 13’0é , The binary magnesite paper was sized to give a 5.6% weight addition of
K succinate. All of these cigarettes, and an additional model made with grade ODS paper from
Kimberly-Clark’s one-step process, gave at least a 50% reduction in sidestrearn:visibility.

PROJECT MAGIC

Mainstream smoldng analyses were completed on a set of four cigarettes made in the
semiworks with‘a 45 glm“ binary magnesite base paper (PlTY) that had been treated by Ecusta
with four separate sizing solutions: potassium citrate/sucrose, potassium citratejsucrose/citric
acidl potassium citrate/sucrose/sulfuric acid, and potassium citratelsulfuric acid. These
cigarettes did not exhibit any significant differences in tar delivery. Sidestream visibility
reductions ranged from 50% to 60%. Subjective screening to date has not shown any of these
additives to‘be superior to potassium suecinate, which was used on previous cigarette model‘s.

ﬂmhﬂ: f Su ested Remarks Following Sur eon General's Report

 

Philip Morris incorporated is a strong advocate of public
‘ debate. It is through such discussion and analysis of the
issues that our citizens are able to reach their own personal
decisions.v When, however, a federal government department
takes it upon itself to prohibit the making of that free choice,

\

we have moved out of the realm of public discussion and into
that of coercion.
This is where Mr. Califano, in his misguided zealousness,
has taken us. Rather than devoting his time and money to in-
‘ creased tobacco and health research, he has chosen to expend
them on a public relations campaign aimed at making:smokerst
appear as second class citizens whose rights are not worth
protecting. Such demagoguery serves only to cloud the issue,
dand is of no value in finding answers to public questions.
In the last twenty years Philip Morris, along with
other members of the tobacco industry, has provided more than
$70 million for independent research on smoking and health
questions. In many of these years this commitment has exceeded
that of any government department, and‘has been substantially

more than the research expenditure reported by all the voluntary

health associations combined.l‘ 1003040251

To: G.R; Telford
FROM: A. Pasheluk
‘ : Tobacco Advertising

The attached article which appeared in‘the "New York Times" on
Thursday; June 30 is cause for concern on many different levels“

One of the:more serious aspects of the legislation is that
affecting the (banned) use of cigarette‘brandtnames in the type
of promotional activities normally used to build and reinfOrce
brand imagery i.e. Newport Ski Spree, associations with local
sporting events such‘as a recent Kent putting contest in Phoenix,
etc.

The legislation does, however, permit use of a corporate name; a
decidedledge for the more well known Philip Morris and RJR.

Now is the time for Lorillard to build‘greater awareness of the
corporate name so that should it become necessary Ci.e; similar
legislation‘as that passed in Canada beingaenacted here) we could
stay competitve in promotional events.

Several vehicles for such a program could be considered: An
adVertising:"Quality" campaign not unlike Ford Motor Company's
"Quality is:Job 1" campaign; simply greater association of the
Lorillard name with branded products via a logo or slogan i.e.
recall Nabisco‘s famous red triangle logo appearing at the end of
all broadcast ads ﬁor agx of their products or, perhaps, the
investigation of the Lorillard name itself on a new brand such as
a potential breakthrough product (as in our Reduced Side Stream‘
project! or; a branded generic product.

If any of‘this sounds reasonable to you we could‘begdn by
evaluating awareness and‘imagery of the Lorillard name and‘then
formulate objectives and strategies to build on and exploit that
equity.

Can we discuss further, at your convenience?

RE: TRUE "QUIT" CAMPAIGN ANALYSIS

I have prepared the following analysis based on the Gallup and Robinson data
for True "Quit” ads tested to date, a total of 15 observations. The ads
tested ran during May, l975 and February, 1976, and included the original .
Tip-in test of the campaign. Although this analysis covers male smokers
only, female data is also available if you find this type of report to

be useful.

This memo will:

l) Track effectiveness over time, and 2) attempt to isolate the
vreasons for success or failure.

Listed below is a re—cap of each G & R observation of a True "Quit" ad.
Also listed are average smoker scores for all cigarette ads (including
True) run in the test issues, and average smoker scores for all Super Hi—Fi
brands (excluding True) run in the test issues.
Initial True scores were above the average for all cigarettes but fell
below average in the third observation. The next 8 observations scored
below average, while recent ads have scored much higher. However, the True
"Quit“ ads have consistently outperformed the average competitive Super Hi-Fi
ads throughout the campaign.

From: N. Jensen.b7f§§?ﬁ’

Subject: Mass Spectral Analysis of Residue from ART Pilot Plant

GC-MS analysis was performed on a sample of residue obtained from the
reactor at the ART pilot plant. This sample was originally submitted by
Jose Nepomuceno, request code Z89095, sample code Z9DS. The sample was
taken up in hexane and analyzed by GC—MS using the JEOL SX 102 mass
spectrometer. A 15 meter, DB-S, 0.25 pm column was used with conditions of
initial temperature 100°C, heating rate of 10°/min., and final temperature
of 325°C with a ten minute hold time. The mass spectrometer was operated in
the electron impact mode (EI) with 70 eV ionization potential, 10 Kev
acceleration and a scan speed of 1 scan/sec over the mass range 0—800.

Figure 1 shows the total ion chromatogram for the sample. Important
components include: hexane solvent (scan 67), neophytadiene (scan 516),
(lS,2E,4R,7E,11E)-2,7,ll-cembratriene-4,6—diol (scan 746) and a number of
long-chained hydrocarbons in the region of 950-1300. Although most of the
components in the region of scan 950—1300 are long-chained hydrocarbon
waxes, there are two notable exceptions. The first is the component
observed at scan 1158 which has a structure that likely contains a
substructure with aromatic character and an aliphatic chain. The second is
the component observed at scan 1205 which appears to have a cholestane type
structure. Absolute identification of these compounds has not been
acheived. '

Comparison of this material to ART materials analyzed previously
reveals no components unique to this residue (see memo: Mass
Spectral Analyses of ART Samples to D. Leyden, from N. Jensen 9/22/89). If
one compares this material to solid material obtained as residue from higher
pressure ART runs, the major difference is in relative distribution of
various components. For this residue sample, the abundances of
neophytadiene, the cembratrienediol and the cholestane type compound are
increased with respect to the abundances of the hydrocarbons as compared to
ART solid material analyzed previously. There are also some differences in
relative distribution within the hydrocarbon region.

The total ion chromatogram for the sample is attached and mass spectra
have been obtained for all components indicated in the TIC. If you need
additional information or have questions please contact me.

SUBJECT: é OSlum on Host Factors in Human Carcinogenesis
Cape Sounion, Greece, June 8—11, 1981

N.B. This memo was held up because we were awaiting
copies of pictures taken by someone of Hirayama's
slides. These prints finally arrived, but not all
are in sharp focus. They are.reproduced at the end
of this memo for whatever information you can de-
rive from them. The prints are a bit clearer and
are being sent to Marvin Kastenbaum for his pro—
fessional perusal.

' ' )(Assab

The symposium, organized by the International Agency for Re-
search on Cancer in Lyon, France, brought together some 100 sci-
EﬁfiEtE_TFEE—T§_countries to discuss the difficult question of
determining the reasons for individual differences in suscepti-

bility to cancer. The objective is to identify those at higher
risk.

Cigarette smoking was mentioned quite frequently, and it was
apparent that virtually each scientist present considered smoking
to be the single greatest menace to health.

X Takeshi Hiraxama of Tokyo, though asked to speak on the sub-
ject of reducing cancer risk by a diet containing daily doses of
green-yellow vegetables, spent the first part of his slide pre-
sentation on the hazards of cigarette smoking. His talk was
garbled and his "slide show" was too rapid, but he was clear
enough on two items: (1) some nonsmoking males get lung cancer
when their wives are heavy smokers, and (2) smoking is at least
as important as diet in the development of stomach cancer. (This
information was reported by us in a special memo during the sym-
posium.)

There was no comment at all from the audience on his cigarette
data, but a lively debate took place over his vegetable results.

Another recent recruit to the antismoking ranks, D?<Tricho—
Boulos of Athens (co-author of a passive smoking report a few
months ago), drew divided opinion with a paper that claimed an
association between smoking and liver cancer.

 

The presentations were lengthy and included reviews of the lit—
erature, methodology, the current state of the art, and some in—
itial advances that, everyone hoped, will contribute to solving
the dilemma of cancer.

Outside Testing Budget

At the end of April the "Outside Testing? budget was underspent

by $323,

327. The seven activities itemiZed below, totaling

$351,720, generally account for underspending.

1.

Drug Enzzme Makeup ($30,000)

There has been an unexpected delay at Borriston
Laboratories in implementing these tests on
schedule.

Immunosu ression Studies ($4,000)
Again, an unexpectedidelay at Borriston
in implementing scheduled tests.

' Absorption—Distribution ($32,000)

There was a one month administrative delay at
Research‘Triangle Institute as a new contract
was initiated. This was followed by a further

2 month delay at Borriston Laboratories- We

do not know if it is possible to make up for
lost time as these studies continue on a monthly
basis.

CNS Activitx Development ($7,500)
This protocol development activity has not
been initiated because of other commitments.

      

 
  

Acute Oral, l4-Da Subchronic, 90—Da‘ Subchronic ($26,400)
The test material D11, D12) was damaged in‘shipment.
Then, Product Development changed the formula because of
unanticipated problems with one of the ingredients. A
new formulation has not been devised. During May and
June budgeted charges amounting to $61,500 will not be
accrued;

 

Skin Painting and‘Condensate Collection ($97,500)
Mechanical equipment failure, technical delays, and
delays due to price negotiations prevented the current
study from starting as budgeted. In addition to the
above, an additional shortfall of $35,000 will be
incurred during May and June.

SUBJECT: STRATEGY LETTER:
1996 - NEWPORT LIGHTS HEAVY-UP TEST

 

The following outlines the details for the planned Newport Lights
heavy—up test beginning April 8, 1996.

BACKGROUND

In evaluating the Full-Price, Lotar Menthol segment of the
marketplace, it appears that there is potential for growth for
Newport Lights. Compared to competitive Lights brands, Newport
Lights has the third highest volume (Salem and K001 are greater).
In addition, the chart below shows that Lights contributes a
smaller percentage of business to the overall Newport franchise
than our competitors.

% 0F FRANCHISE

 

Marlboro

Newport Kool Salem Menthol
Full Flavor 89 77 53 38
Lights 11 23 47 62

Newport is a heavily Urban Center driven brand, while its key
competition is either more evenly split between General Market and
Urban Center, or is. General Market driven. This creates a
disadvantage for Newport Lights, because the Lotar Menthol category
is heavily dominated by the General Market. Since Newport Lights
is underdeveloped vs. this target audience, we feel that there may
be an opportunity to build Newport Light’s business by increasing
the brand's presence in the General Market.

Therefore, starting April 8, 1996, we will implement a Newport
Lights heavy—up test in two test markets. The objective of the
program is to determine business building opportunities for Newport
Lights in the General Market. The test will strive to increase
brand awareness and marketplace presence by utilizing a combination
of a distribution drive and increased/specialized marketing support
in the form of Advertising and Promotion.

QUARTERLY REPORT

Cigarettes were machine-made from Marlboro filler
containing 5, 10 and 20% of a shreddedh carbonized filler.
Reductions in TPMwand CO delivery have been found; confirming
data obtained on eight different tests of hand—made cigarettes
and an earlier test on machine-made cigarettes“ The cigarettes
are mild-tasting and do not appear to produce fiery particles.

Hand—made cigarettes were fabricated having a carbon
core derived fromwa laterally crimped cellulosic non-woven
sheet. No fiery particles were produced during smoking,
and the ash has the same appearance as a control cigarette
having no carbonxcore. This potentially low cost cigarette
is expected to provide reduced TPM and gas phase delivery
without sacrifice in taste. It could overcome the problem
of brittleness encountered with the shredded carbon filler.
The cigarettes may also serve asra research model for investi-
gation of combustion phenomena in the cigarette.

Studies continue in our efforts to correlate the chemistry
of smoking substrates such as burley stems and cellulose,
with the nature of the resulting smoke. Using cellulose
as a model, it has been discovered that carbonyl groups
produced by chemical oxidation of primary hydroxyl groups
undergo rapid decarboxylation‘at low pyrolysis temperature
(240°C). It is unlikely that the resultant product can
form levoglucosan, the primary initial degradation product
of cellulose. This may give some insight into‘an explanation
as to why oxidized cellulose produces milder smoker than
untreated cellulose. Other carboxyl groups, such as those
produced by air oxidation, are more resistant to decarboxyla—
tion. Aside from the informative value of this knowledge,
it presents a novel route toward the utilization of most
of the Briskin-type oxidized celluloses.

Work continued on providing samples of ozone treated
hurley stem material to J. Swain for subjective smoking
evaluation. Results to date indicate reduced harshness
of smoker Further studies are underway to ascertain the
effects of ammonium carboxylate groups in themselves and
in combination with reduction of carbohydrate molecular
weight. It has been found that the carboxyl content of

SUBJECT: PM USA Statement/OSHA

 

Last night PM USA released a statement in which we
called on the Occupational Safety and Health Administration

(OSHA) to withdraw its plan to virtually ban smoking from the
nation's workplaces.

Our statement coincides with our submission today, to
OSHA, of a five-volume legal brief outlining why we believe
OSHA‘s plan is flawed.

A copy of PM USA's statement is on the back of this
sheet. I hope you will take a few minutes to read it.

quﬂ: CONCORD'S PROMOTIONAL TECHNIQUE *

In order to create trade and consumer excitement about the
introduction of Concord, PM USA came up with two interesting promotions:

For Trade:

To introduce customers to this new product, key accounts were
given portable stereo cassettes which contained a tape featuring the
Concord message. (The stereo cassette was theirs to keep.) The
volume on the cassette was pre-set at the highest level possible.
Introductory music was the first sound you heard, followed by the
text. The text began by informing the listener that the announcer
knew what the listener had just done -- he adjusted the sound to the
tone that was comfortable for his easy listening. The announcer then
informed the listener that he could also adjust his tar level from
5 mg. to 15 mg. per cigarette, depending on his mood. The announcer
invited the listener to try a free sample of the Concord cigarettes
which were enclosed with the cassette recorder and tape. A copy of
the Concord Regular and Concord Menthol texts are attached for your
review.

For Consumers:

Besides the usual, free samples, two-for-one deals (lighter free)
and carton give-aways (Concord Solar Calculators), Concord offered a
sweepstakes whereby consumers automatically entered into the drawing

when they redeemed their coupons. Top prize consisted of a Ford

Mustang, a Hawaiian Cruise or $15,000 cash. Coupons were inserted

in magazines, newspapers and supplements. When a consumer rubbed off

the top right portion of the game card insert, he was entitled to a

free pack or carton of Concord. When he redeemed the game card for his
prize, he wrote his name and address on the bottom of the card, as well
as marked off the prize he wished to be eligible to win. The coupon

was then automatically entered into the "Suit Your Taste" Sweepstakes.
(Copies of the coupon and free samples are attached for your information.

Should you be interested in a dial-a—tar introduction, you may like
to adapt the above ideas.

RE: ' TRUE IMAGE STUDY —— Psychographic Analysis

This memo should serve to further explain the specifics of the
psychographic lifestyle clustering we will be utilizing in the
image study. It should be noted that this particular analysis
is being used here on an experimental basis due to a limited
working knowledge of its usefulness in this area (there is
little historical data on this subject which can be used for
comparison), and because of the relatively small sample size in
this study. We are hopeful, though, that the incorporation of
the lifestyle clusters can further enhance the analysis and
provide additional direction for the agency‘s purposes.

As you know, the lifestyle clusters are derived from a series
of sequential steps beginning with the self—administered list
of statements which the respondent rates in terms of how well
the statement describes him/her. The particular list we are
using in this study is a general one with no smoker-related
items and was supplied by an outside expert who has vast
experience with psychographics. It is our feeling that this
general list is sufficient for our purposes at this time.

The next step in the sequence is the utilization of a factor
analysis which will group items that correlate together across
the sample of respondents into five or six groupings which we
will label as "Quality Consciousness“, "Conservatism",
"Sociability", etc. Then a cluster analysis is done which
groups people that correlate together for their rating of the
items or for demographic profiles (such as older/younger).

Assuming that the groupings we get are able to discriminate,
the technique will provide us with an additional area of
analysis of our potential market — their lifestyle
characteristics - in addition to demographics.

Marlboro Promotion Programs Qualitative Report

Attached is the moderator‘s report on the recently conducted series of focus groups on
Marlboro promotion ideas developed by Young & Rubicam. Key findings include:

- "Marlboro Country" offers opportunities to broaden and contemporize the brand's
image through connections to both environmentalism and adventure.

- The concept of ”The Marlboro Foundation" which would purchase open land for

preservation offered particularly strong imagery and made consumers feel good about
choosing Marlboro. However, there was also considerable cynicism as to the company's
motives which made any retail tie—in suspect.

a The "Marlboro Adventure Team“ concept (as executed by Y&R) offered greater
potential for promotional programs but was more limited in its imagery. While some
men relished the idea of an all out adventure in Marlboro Country, most were somewhat

intimidated. They would prefer weekend hiking or fishing trips rather than more
strenuous "Adventures."

- Some of the later groups combined the ideas and were excited by the concept of a
Marlboro Environmental SWAT Team that would perform “heroic“ clean-ups and

respond to natural disasters such as Hurricane Andrew. There appeared to be strong

appeal to the idea of modern-day Marlboro Men publicly performing strenuous ”good
deeds.“

Subject: wiegand Evaporator Evaluation status - 5/18/92

Turbofan operation

Fan vibration was monitored relative to daily fan washes and
results indicate that the spray nozzle does reduce turbofan
vibration in some cases. For example, on 5/14 fan vibration
decreased from 5.7 mm/sec to 3.7 mm/sec after the fan was cleaned.
Investigation work is continuing to assess the feasibility of

caustic or citric spray to the fan and to determine the need for
surge protection in our system.

Cleaning of the Evaporator

Lab services is in the process of setting up new test methods for
% acid and % caustic using‘ the automatic titrator at Bermuda
Hundred. WHA test.request has been completed to begin baseline"
testing. However, due to the Memorial Day shutdown and CIP

schedules, the sampling has been delayed and is estimated to begin
on 5/29.

A detailed review of the citric acid product data sheets and
material safety' data sheets has revealed that there are some
potentially significant differences between Nalco, Chemtreat, and
Industrial citric acids. The Nalco and Chemtreat citric acids
appear to be a blend of citric acid with other dispersing agents

while Industrial citric contains only citric acid. Samples will be
pulled for further evaluation.

In order to further determine the source and amount of particulate
materials in the system, plans are to open the top of the
evaporator and clean/inspect the distribution plates prior to a
CIP, immediately after a CIP, and three days later prior to the

next CIP. This evaluation will be conducted as
production/maintenance schedules allow.

Baseline solubles testing of the individual passes was conducted
from 4/29 through 5/7. The results are summarized in the attached
table. Each set of data represents the time between a CIP. The
results indicate very repeatable performance of each pass. The
results are being evaluated relative to the number of tubes in each

pass. Similar testing will be conducted on a monthly basis to
monitor the process for changes.

Product Requirements: Vantage, Mark VII and New Leaf Identified Tests

As you know, we are planning to undertake personal placement tests in 4 cities
of identified Vantage, New Leaf and Mark VII. In order to implement these tests,
we require 32,000 cigarettes(160 cartons) each of New Leaf and Mark VII. "(The
Vantage cigarettes will be purchased from jobbers in each city.) All brand and
other identifying markings on both the cartons and individual packages are not

to be removed, since these are identified tests. Finally, we must insure that both
the Mark VII and New Leaf cigarettes are of comparable age.

 

It must be understood that the Mark VII being referred to here is the product that

is currently being sold in the Tucson test market, and not the new or improved versions
currently being developed by R&D.

The 160 cartons of both Mark VII and New Leaf should be divided into the following
quantities and shipped to these addresses for tax stamping purposes:

- Milprint Pulp Contract

The December meeting of the Board of Directors of Philip Morris Incorporated
approved in principle authorization of a pulp contract to be signed by Milprint
subject to clearing up two questions Legal raised. The Corporate Legal Depart-
ment has raised no further questions about the contract, and after speaking to
each member of the Executive Committee, I have authorized Milprint to enter
final negotiations with The Great Lakes Pulp and Paper Company for the purchase
of 12,000 tons of pulp annually for ten years beginning in 1976.

Currently, Nicolet is paying $265.00 per ton. For purposes of calculation, it
could be assumed that the pulp purchased under the proposed contract will cost
approximately $300.00 per ton.

The Great Lakes Pulp and Paper Company, which is controlled by the Canadian
Pacific Railroad, has been a supplier to Nicolet for seven years. The relation-
ship has been mutually satisfactory and Great Lakes' reputation is excellent.

The Milprint contract is a “take and pay“ contract as are the others, and the
financing of the new mill will be based on this paper. The mill will have a

capacity of 300,000 tons annually, 250,000 of which have already been committed
to Milprint, Johnson and Johnson, Bergstrom Paper Company, National Cash Register,
Proctor and Gamble, St. Regis Paper, Nekoosa Edwards, Fox River Paper and Landon

Paper.

The contract price will be the prevailing market price at the time of purchase
and although there is no contract guarantee that the price paid will be the
lowest price available, pulp prices have traditionally been uniform within the
industry. If the mill is not in operation by l976, we can withdraw from the
contract.

This annual 12,000 tons of pulp could be used in emergencies for flip top box
and soft pack production for the Philip Morris tobacco operations.

Milprint will sign the contract since Nicolet is not a legal corporation. No
guarantee will be required from Philip Morris.

At $300 per ton, this contract could total $36 million.

*. suMeOtI -Nitrate Reduction in BL

A meeting was held at R&D on February l0 to review the status of various
process develbpment programs related to the above subject and to try to finm
up our future plans in this area. Those in.attendance were:

H. G. Burnley‘ C. R. Hayward
K. S. Burns D. J. Kelton

H. A. Farone N. R. Rowe

H. F. Gannon N. R. Wilkinson

G. Gellat‘ly~

After extensive discussion on a number of relevant subjects, the following
course of action was agreed upon:
- I l. Manuﬁacturing Engineering will sample and characterize the
various effluent streams from the BL Plant containing significant levels

of nitnate and determine which streams must be treated (by some presently
- ‘undefined method) to meet future EPA‘specifications.

_ 2. In one initial trial, Dr. Farone and his staﬁf have shown that
reduction of the nitrate in the BL effluent by a microbiological process is
feasible. Unden the current schedule. they would expect to have a pilot plant
for this process operating in about 12 months. Optimizationistudies using the
specific effluents to be treatedicouldlrequire another 3—6 months after the
pilot plant is openational.

3. After reviewing the burley stem pressing process that R&D has
‘ I proposed to replace the current washing/drying operation, it was decided that
#25 ' a better assessment of the potentiallenergy savings from such a process was
necessary. Manufacturing Engineeringxagreed to carry out suchia study.

They (Manufacturing Engineering) also agreed to determine if
9 adequate space was avaidable at the BL Plant to install the pnessingisystem

’lﬂkct ' parallel toithe pnesent equipment. This was considered desirable since this

process is difficult to pilot completely.

4. If the findings in #3 are favorable, R&D will conduct a series
0 of tnials using the Reneburg presses in the RL Pilot Plant to determine if
\ the many difﬁerent types of stems processediat the BU Plant can be dewatened
LJ~"J to a reasonably constant average 0V. QThe presses neconmended by R&D are
made by Bauer Company and are more of a pr€Cl510n made PIECE 0f equipment that
should give less moisture variation than the Reneburg. Unfortunately, however,
Bauer dees not have a pilot unit that we can buy or rent.)

Audio

No sound on sets in areas other than loun§ES and bar/dining

Commercial Placement

Extremely poor. The spots are run, as noted, under format,
after the race has been finalized in all respects and all fans are once

SUBJECT! 'MINUTES'OF MARCH 10, 1982 P.D.C. MEETING

The following paragraphs summarize our discussions:

1. SALES REVIEW - Our 1981 experience with the A.I.D. program‘
and a comparison of it with the newly announced Philip Morris
program were discussed. Other competitive activities reviewed
included Brown and Williamson‘s Plan I Bonus program and
additional give-aways;_R. J. Reynold's seemingly endless spending
spree including the 10% bonus for exclusive Plan II's, the K—Mart

exclusive pack sales deal, and increased payments for out-of-
home.

2. ESTABLISHED BRANDS - Advertising flighting schedules for all
brands were rev1ewed. The decision to promote NEWPORT RED in
two, rather than the previously-announced six markets, was an-
nounced; as was the upgrading of Florida, Texas, and California
to core status on NEWPORT parent later this year. Also reviewed
were the new promotion plans for parent KENT utilizing the
spring-summer-fall events.

Discussions on TRUE centered‘mainly on the application of the
laser technology and-the apparent success of the new marketing

-activities. The GOLDEN LIGHTS ULTRA and MAX SLIM LIGHTS projects

were reviewedu

3. NEW BRANDS — Heritage has been withdrawn from the Jackson

market; support will continue in Lexington where a 0.47% S.O.M.
currently exists. REBEL continues to perform very well in Erie
and fair in Roanoke. Possibilities of a box packing and also a
metro area test will be two topics for discussion at the "next—

steps" meeting to be held in three or four weeks. An up-date is
attached.

The SATIN CONCEPT/PRODUCT TEST results were reviewed and
everything looks extremely promising for this brand.
